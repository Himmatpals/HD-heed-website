          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Got it. We’ll make sure not to duplicate and will ask your permission to touch base with your OT if needed. Any safety considerations at home—falls risk, allergies, or transfer notes?”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Thanks for letting me know. We’ll brief our staff with safe techniques and, if you’re happy, ask the OT for any transfer guidance. In terms of timing, which days and times suit you best?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “Mornings are best—say 9 to 11 AM on weekdays. Outings could be Tuesdays or Thursdays.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “That works. We’ll aim for a small, consistent team so you see familiar faces. We’ll also send your roster a week ahead and text you about any changes. For admin: we’ll prepare a simple service agreement outlining hours and costs within NDIS price limits. We can go through it together—no surprises.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “Sounds good. I get anxious about budgets.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Totally understandable. We’ll plan conservative hours initially, monitor usage, and adjust if needed so your supports stretch across the plan year. You’ll stay fully in control.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “Okay. What’s next?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Next, I’ll propose a starter schedule (e.g., Mon–Fri mornings 2 hrs, and a 2-hr community access mid-week), email a draft agreement, and—if you agree—book your first visit. After 2–3 weeks, we’ll check in and tweak anything that’s not perfect.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “Great. Let’s do that.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Brilliant. I’ll send everything today and we’ll get you started. Thanks for your time, [Preferred Name]!”</p>

            <div>
              <p><em>“Dad is hard of hearing—will he still be included?”</em><br>
              Yes. We’ll speak clearly, use speakerphone or captions if needed, and check in directly with him. We’ll involve him in key choices at every step.</p>

              <p><em>“We don’t want to disrupt current therapy.”</em><br>
              We’ll keep OT/Physio as-is and focus on daily living and companionship. We coordinate with therapists to follow their guidance.</p>

              <p><em>“I manage the logistics—can you contact me first?”</em><br>
              Absolutely. We’ll record you as the primary contact for scheduling/updates, while ensuring your dad’s consent and involvement.</p>

              <p><em>“Will this fit the budget?”</em><br>
              We’ll plan hours within Core funding and monitor usage. If we need to adjust, we’ll do it together to protect essentials.</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Hello, this is [Name] from [Your Organization]. I’m looking to speak with [Family Member Name] – I was told you’re the best contact regarding [Participant Name]’s NDIS supports?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Yes, that’s me. I’m [Participant Name]’s daughter. Thanks for calling.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Thank you for reaching out on [Participant Name]’s behalf. How are you both doing today?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “We’re doing alright. My dad (Participant) is here with me. He’s a bit hard of hearing, so I tend to handle the phone conversations.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “I understand. Hi [Participant Name] (speaking a bit louder and clearer)! I’m [Name] from [Org]. I’m talking with your daughter to make sure we arrange the supports you need. How are you today?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span> (in background): “Oh, hello! I’m okay, thank you.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “He can hear you on speaker now. He knows we’re arranging some help for him.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Great, I’ll continue to chat with both of you. So, I understand [Participant Name] has an NDIS plan, and you’re helping to organize his services. Could you tell me a bit about what prompted you to contact us and what supports you’re looking for?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Sure. My dad had a stroke last year. He’s on the NDIS and currently has some physio and occupational therapy, but we’re looking to get him a regular support worker. I’m worried about him being alone most of the day when I’m at work. He could use help with meals and just someone around in case he needs anything. His speech isn’t great and his right side is weak.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Got it. Thank you for the background. So he’s already receiving physio and OT – is that through another provider or directly through NDIS?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “It’s through another clinic. They’re doing a good job with therapy, so we’d like to keep that as is. What we really need from you is more on the daily living side – kind of like in-home care and companionship.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Absolutely, we can cover that. We have support workers who can come to your dad’s home and help with daily tasks (like preparing lunch, light housekeeping, etc.) and also just be there as a companion, maybe take him for a walk or to the local park if he’s up for it. We can tailor the activities to what he enjoys and what keeps him safe.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span> (background): “I do get lonely sometimes, yes.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “He used to be very active socially, so it’s been hard.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “I understand. Social connection is so important. We’ll definitely aim to match him with a support worker who shares some of his interests. For example, what does your dad like? Any hobbies or topics he enjoys?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “He loves gardening and watching cricket. He can’t garden like he used to, but he enjoys sitting outside.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “That’s great to know. We actually have a support worker in our team, [Support Worker Name], who is an avid cricket fan and is skilled in helping with light gardening tasks. Someone like that might be a good fit to accompany your dad, talk cricket, maybe help him water the plants or just get some fresh air outside safely.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Oh, that sounds promising! Dad, what do you think? Someone to talk cricket with you?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “That would be nice.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Wonderful. Now, let’s talk logistics for a moment. [Participant Name], your NDIS plan – do you know if it’s self-managed or plan-managed, or NDIA-managed? Basically, who pays the bills from the plan?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “It’s agency-managed. The NDIS pays providers directly. He doesn’t handle any of that.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Thanks, that means we’ll just make service bookings in the system and claim payments directly. No worry there. And do you happen to know how many hours or funding is allocated for his daily support? I want to ensure we plan within his budget.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “He has about $20k a year in core supports available. We were thinking of starting with maybe 3 hours a day, Monday to Friday, around midday to afternoon.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “That sounds reasonable. Rough math, that should be sustainable with $20k for quite a few months, and then plans usually renew annually. We can fine-tune it. We’ll help you keep track so it doesn’t overrun the budget. And if we find he needs more or less, we can adjust.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Okay, great. Another thing: I usually coordinate everything for him. Is it alright if I continue to be the main contact with you? I’ll make sure he’s informed and involved in decisions, but it’s just easier for scheduling and so on.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Of course. We appreciate having a dedicated family contact—it often makes communication smoother. We will involve your dad in any key discussions (since it’s about him), but for day-to-day things like scheduling or updates, I’m happy to call or email you. If at any time your dad wants to speak directly with us or have a one-on-one meeting, we can do that too.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Email works for me for records, but phone or text for anything urgent or scheduling is fine too.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Noted. I’ll get all your contacts. Next, I’d like to schedule a home visit to meet you both in person. During that visit, we can introduce a potential support worker (like the cricket-fan I mentioned) to see if it’s a good fit. We’ll also go over a service agreement—that’s a plain-English document listing what we’ll do and our obligations. Would you be comfortable with that?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Yes, that’s fine. I’d appreciate seeing things in writing.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Perfect. I can email you a draft before the meeting. Is there a day next week that works for a visit? I can bring that support worker to introduce.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Wednesday afternoon is good. I can be there by 3 PM.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Okay, Wednesday at 3 PM. Does that suit you too, [Participant Name]?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “Yes.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Great! We’ll be there. If you could gather any relevant therapy notes—like transfer techniques from OT—it helps our worker support your dad safely.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Yes, the OT gave us a sheet. I’ll have it ready.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Perfect. Feel free to think of any other questions. Our goal is to support your dad and make both of you feel confident and comfortable. You’ve done a fantastic job so far—we’re here to share the load.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Thank you. I’m hopeful this will help him and me.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “I’m sure it will. I’ll send an email now with my contact info, the draft service agreement, and the appointment confirmation. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up before then.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Will do. Thanks for your help today.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “Thank you.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “You’re both very welcome. Take care, and see you soon.”</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>How do you prevent overlap?</strong> We document scope, share rosters with active providers, and coordinate via a single update thread.</li>
            <li><strong>What if there’s no rapport with the first worker?</strong> We rematch quickly — choice & control first.</li>
            <li><strong>How do you protect tight funding?</strong> Start small, phase supports, monthly usage checks, prioritise must-have routines.</li>
            <li><strong>What reporting does the SC get?</strong> Weekly summary; same-day incident alerts; 4-week review then periodic reviews as requested.</li>
            <li><strong>How fast can you start?</strong> With a “starter brief” + consent we can begin safely while fuller docs arrive.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Behaviours are communication. We look for <em>triggers</em> and <em>what works</em> to keep everyone safe.</li>
            <li>If restrictive practices exist (e.g., PRN medication, lap belt), confirm they are authorised and documented.</li>
            <li>Keep the team small and consistent; brief staff thoroughly before first shift.</li>
            <li>Plan for crisis: de-escalation steps, who to call, and when to escalate.</li>

              <li>What helps: proven calming strategies, interests, sensory tools.</li>
              <li>PBSP details: practitioner name, latest version, consent to obtain.</li>
              <li>Restrictive practices: which ones, authorisation status, PRN protocols.</li>
              <li>Safety needs: staffing (1:1 / 2:1), environmental setup, items to secure.</li>
              <li>Communication style: verbal, AAC/device, key phrases that help.</li>
              <li>Other professionals: psychologist, psychiatrist, GP, behaviour practitioner.</li>

          <div class="script">
            <p><strong>Intake (Clinical):</strong> Hello, this is [Your Name] from [Organisation]. I’m calling about supports for [Participant]. Is now okay?</p>
            <p><strong>Family:</strong> Yes, thank you. It’s a bit stressful, to be honest.</p>
            <p><strong>Intake:</strong> I understand. This is a judgement-free chat. I’d like to learn what works for [Participant] and how we can keep everyone safe. Could you tell me what a tough moment looks like and what usually sets it off?</p>
            <p><strong>Family:</strong> Transitions and noise. He might yell, throw things, or hit. It happens a few times a week.</p>
            <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Thank you. What helps most when that starts?</p>
            <p><strong>Family:</strong> Space, removing things he could throw, and talking calmly about trains.</p>
            <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Great—space, safety, and a favourite topic. Do you have a behaviour plan and any PRN medication protocol?</p>
            <p><strong>Family:</strong> Yes, a psychologist wrote a Positive Behaviour Support Plan. PRN is included as a last resort.</p>
            <p><strong>Intake:</strong> That’s helpful. With your permission, I’ll request the plan and any recent incident notes so we align with it. Are any other restrictive practices in use?</p>
            <p><strong>Family:</strong> No physical restraint. Only PRN if needed.</p>
            <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Understood. For staffing, would 2:1 ever be needed, or is trained 1:1 fine?</p>
            <p><strong>Family:</strong> 1:1 is usually fine if the person is trained and calm.</p>
            <p><strong>Intake:</strong> We’ll assign experienced staff and brief them before attendance. We’ll start with a casual meet-and-greet so trust can build. How does Thursday 3 PM at home (backyard with the train set) sound?</p>
            <p><strong>Family:</strong> Perfect.</p>
            <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Great. I’ll send a summary, collect the PBSP and authorisations, and bring a short crisis plan template we can finalise together. You’ll have a direct number for urgent issues. Does that feel okay?</p>
            <p><strong>Family:</strong> Yes, that’s reassuring. Thank you.</p>

            <p><strong>Intake:</strong> When something feels too hard or noisy, what helps you feel better? Do trains help?</p>
            <p><strong>Participant:</strong> Talking about trains helps.</p>
            <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Great. We’ll make sure staff know to use trains as a calm topic. If we need a break, we’ll say “Let’s have 5 minutes” and move to a quiet spot. Does that sound good?</p>
            <p><strong>Participant:</strong> Yes.</p>

            <summary>Will you use PRN medication?</summary>

          <details>
            <summary>Can we choose who comes to our home?</summary>
