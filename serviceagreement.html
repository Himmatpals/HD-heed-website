  <h3>Provider Travel – Labour Costs</h3>
  <p>Travel time to and from your location may be charged at the support hourly rate, capped at 30 minutes each way in metro areas and 60 minutes in regional/remote areas, unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>

  <h3>Provider Travel – Non-Labour Costs</h3>
  <p>You must reimburse vehicle running expenses at $0.78/km, plus tolls, parking, or public transport costs at actual cost with receipts. Travel costs must be pre-agreed and itemised on invoices.</p>

  <h3>Payment Options</h3>
  <p>Select the applicable option for your funding:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Self-managed:</b> You pay invoices within an agreed time (e.g., 7 days).</li>
    <li><b>Plan Nominee:</b> Your nominee pays invoices within agreed time.</li>
    <li><b>NDIA-managed:</b> HD HeeD claims directly from NDIA.</li>
    <li><b>Plan-managed:</b> HD HeeD claims from your nominated Plan Manager.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Cancellations</h2>
  <h3>Short Notice Cancellations</h3>
  <p>Where HD HeeD has a Short Notice Cancellation (or no show), we can claim up to 100% of the agreed fee associated with the activity from the participant’s plan, subject to the NDIS Pricing Arrangement and Price Limits and the terms of this Service Agreement.</p>

  <h3>Short Notice Cancellation – 2 clear business days</h3>
  <p>This applies to non-disability support worker supports where you have provided less than two (2) clear business days’ notice of cancellation for a support, or if you do not show up for a scheduled support within a reasonable time or are not present at the agreed place within a reasonable time when one of our workers is travelling to deliver the support.</p>
  <p>This applies if we are not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and we are required to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.</p>
  <p>We may choose to waive the Short Notice Cancellation fee at our discretion, if we agree that your circumstances warrant this on a particular occasion.</p>

  <h3>Short Notice Cancellation – 7 clear business days</h3>
  <p>This applies to disability support worker supports where you have provided less than seven (7) clear business days’ notice of cancellation for a support, or if you do not show up for a scheduled support within a reasonable time, or are not present at the agreed place within a reasonable time when one of our workers is travelling to deliver the support.</p>
  <p>This applies if we are not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and we are required to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.</p>
  <p>We may choose to waive the Short Notice Cancellation fee at our discretion, if we agree that your circumstances warrant this on a particular occasion.</p>

  <p>For supports delivered to a group of participants, including you, if you cancel your attendance and if we are unable to find another participant to attend the group session in your place, then, if the other requirements for a Short Notice cancellation are met, we will bill you at the previously agreed rate that we would have billed you if you had attended the session.</p>
  <p>Claims for a short notice cancellation will be made using the same support item as would have been used if the support had been delivered, using the ‘cancellation’ option in the myplace portal.</p>
  <p>If we observe an unusual number of short notice cancellations we will discuss with you to seek to understand why they are occurring and arrange more suitable shift times and days.</p>

  <h2>Feedback and Complaints</h2>
  <p>If you, as the participant, or your representative, wish to provide us with feedback, or lodge a complaint in relation to services received from HD HeeD, you can talk to our Director on <b>0469857821</b>.</p>
  <p>If you are not satisfied with the handling of the complaint or do not want to talk to our Complaints Manager or delegate regarding your complaint, you can contact the <b>NDIS Commission</b> at any time by calling <b>1800 035 544</b>, visiting one of their offices in person, or accessing the NDIS website for further information.</p>

    <li>A supply of supports under this Service Agreement is a supply of one or more reasonable and necessary supports specified in the statement of supports included under s 33(2) of the NDIS Act, in the participant’s NDIS Plan currently in effect under s 37 of the NDIS Act.</li>
    <li>The participant’s NDIS plan is expected to remain in effect during the period the supports are provided.</li>
