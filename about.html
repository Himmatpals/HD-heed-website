          I’ve spent the last five years immersing myself in the disability and aged-care sector, and what I’ve learned most is that genuine connection comes before anything else.
          I draw on my background in behaviour support, neuro-observations and medication coordination to build care plans that fit each person’s daily rhythm—whether that’s perfecting a wound-care routine or finding the right community activity to boost confidence.
          I love rolling up my sleeves alongside families and allied-health teams, brainstorming creative solutions—from modifying a bathroom for independence to choreographing a small garden outing—that spark real moments of joy.
          Friends and colleagues appreciate my patient approach: I listen first, ask the tough questions, then adapt on the spot when needs shift.
          At the heart of my work is the belief that everyone deserves both expertise and empathy, and that together we can turn care into opportunity.
