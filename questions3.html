                            <p><span class="highlight">Purpose of the Call:</span> The initial phone call with a potential client (or their representative) serves as both a screening and onboarding conversation. Your goal is to determine if and how you can meet the caller's needs, explain your services, and guide them toward the next steps. Keep the call professional yet warm – think of it as the first step in building a supportive relationship, not a rushed transaction.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Key Principles:</span></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="highlight">Empathy and Active Listening:</span> Start by warmly greeting the caller, introducing yourself and your organization. Listen actively to their story or inquiry without interruption. Acknowledge their feelings or any challenges they mention. Establishing trust from the first moments is critical, especially in disability support contexts.</li>
                                <li><span class="highlight">Clarity and Simplicity:</span> Use clear, jargon-free language. Many callers may not be familiar with all NDIS terms, so explain concepts when needed. Avoid overwhelming them with too much detail upfront – focus on the essentials the caller needs to know right now.</li>
                                <li><span class="highlight">Person-Centered Approach:</span> Every participant's situation is unique. Tailor the conversation to their needs and goals. Ask open-ended questions to understand what support they are looking for and what matters most to them. This not only provides you information but also empowers the caller to voice their priorities.</li>
                                <li><span class="highlight">Gather Key Information:</span> Have an intake checklist handy. Early in the call (after a bit of rapport), gently collect important details:</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Important details to collect:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="highlight">Participant's Name, Age, and Disability</span> (for context of needs)</li>
                                <li><span class="highlight">Caller's Relationship</span> to participant (self, family member, coordinator, etc.)</li>
                                <li><span class="highlight">NDIS Status:</span> Do they have an NDIS plan already? Confirm basics like NDIS number, how their plan is managed, and key support areas they have funding for</li>
                                <li><span class="highlight">Location and Service Needs:</span> Where do they live and what supports are they interested in?</li>
                                <li><span class="highlight">Current Situation:</span> Are they starting services for the first time, transitioning from another provider, or needing urgent support?</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Explain Services and Value:</span> Give a concise overview of your organization and how you can help. Mention that you are an NDIS Registered Provider, which means you meet strict quality and safety standards. Highlight key services you offer tailored to what they need.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Invite Questions and Concerns:</span> Throughout the call, encourage the caller to ask any questions. Be prepared to answer common FAQs. Address concerns truthfully and positively, framing answers in a "Yes, we can help with that" manner whenever possible.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Next Steps:</span> End the call with a clear plan. This might include scheduling a follow-up assessment, outlining the intake paperwork, explaining any necessary coordination, providing your contact info, and reassuring them they can call back with any further questions.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Tone and Professionalism:</span> Maintain a friendly, caring tone. Use the caller's name and the participant's name during the call. Keep notes of important details. Before hanging up, thank them for contacting you and reinforce that you're looking forward to supporting them.</p>
                            
                            <p>Remember, the initial phone call often leaves a lasting impression – you want the person to feel heard, informed, and confident that your service will meet their needs.</p>

They may be nervous or unsure about the process if they're new to NDIS. Be patient and informative, giving a good first impression of a well-organized, caring provider.</p>

                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: What services do you provide under NDIS?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> We offer a range of NDIS-funded supports. Our core services include assistance with daily personal activities (such as help with showering, dressing, meal prep), domestic assistance (household tasks), community participation (support to go out for shopping, appointments or social activities), and nursing care for any health-related needs. We tailor services to each person – during our initial assessment we'll discuss exactly what support you want and create a plan around your goals.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: Are you a registered NDIS provider?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> Yes, we are fully NDIS Registered. This means we have met the government's strict quality and safety standards for providers. Being registered also means if your plan is NDIA-managed, we can make service bookings and claims directly through the NDIS portal. You can have confidence that we adhere to all the NDIS Practice Standards – in other words, you're in safe and qualified hands.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: How much experience do you have? How do I know I can trust your service?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> [Your Organization] has been supporting people under the NDIS since [Year]. We have extensive experience working with participants of all ages and needs – from basic daily support to very high care needs. Many of our team members have years (even decades) of experience in disability support. We pride ourselves on quality – for example, we undergo regular audits to maintain our NDIS registration and even have additional accreditation to prove our high standards. We're happy to share testimonials or connect you with existing clients who can speak to our reliability and care. Ultimately, we let our track record speak – our focus is building trust by delivering on what we promise.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: Who are your staff? Are they qualified?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> Our support staff come from a range of professional backgrounds in disability and community care. Every support worker undergoes thorough training to ensure they can provide respectful, safe, and empowering support. We provide ongoing training beyond the basic certifications. All staff have cleared relevant background checks. We also try to match staff to participants thoughtfully – if you have any preferences, we'll do our best to accommodate that. Our goal is to have a skilled team member that you feel comfortable with.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: What areas do you service?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> We currently provide services across [list regions]. If you're unsure whether we cover your suburb, let me know where you are – I'll confirm. If it turns out you're outside our service area, I can help refer you to a provider closer to you.</p>

                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: How soon can you start services?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> We understand many people need support as soon as possible. Our intake process can be quite quick. Typically, after this call, we would arrange to meet you to develop a Service Agreement and support plan. We can often begin services within [X] days of signing the agreement – sometimes sooner, depending on staff availability and your schedule. If there's urgency, please let us know – we will prioritize getting things in place quickly.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: What's the process to get started?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> The process is straightforward:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="highlight">Initial Assessment:</span> We'll schedule a time where we do a more detailed assessment of your needs and goals.</li>
                                <li><span class="highlight">Service Agreement:</span> We'll put together a Service Agreement that outlines what supports we'll provide, the rates, and terms.</li>
                                <li><span class="highlight">Staff Matching:</span> We select a suitable support worker based on your preferences and needs.</li>
                                <li><span class="highlight">Commencement:</span> Services begin as scheduled. We'll check in with you frequently in the early days to ensure things are going well.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: Do I have to sign a Service Agreement?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> While it's not legally mandatory, the NDIS strongly encourages having a written Service Agreement with your provider – and we find it's best practice for clarity. The Service Agreement protects you because it clearly states what we will deliver and any terms of service. We keep our agreements very straightforward and in plain language. We will never lock you in indefinitely – you remain in control and can change or cancel the agreement if your needs or preferences change.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: How are services billed and paid?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> This depends on how your NDIS plan is managed:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If you're NDIA-managed: We will create a service booking in the NDIS portal and claim payments directly from your NDIS funding.</li>
                                <li>If you're Plan-managed: We will send our invoices to your Plan Management provider.</li>
                                <li>If you're Self-managed: We will send invoices to you directly.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In all cases, the rates we charge are per the NDIS Pricing Arrangements, so no out-of-pocket costs for you.</p>

                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: Do you charge any additional fees or travel costs?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> We follow the NDIS pricing rules on any additional charges. For example, if a support worker needs to travel to your home, NDIS allows providers to charge a travel fee – but within strict limits. We will be transparent about any such charges: they would all be clearly listed in the Service Agreement and come out of your NDIS funds, not your pocket. We do not have hidden fees.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: What is your cancellation policy?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> Our cancellation policy is aligned with the NDIS policy. The NDIS requires 7 clear days' notice to cancel a scheduled support without charge. This means if you cancel a service with less than 7 days' notice, we are permitted to charge the cost of that service. However, we understand emergencies happen – we encourage you to let us know as soon as possible if you need to cancel or reschedule, and we'll be as flexible as we can.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: What if I start services and then decide I want to stop or switch provider?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> You are always in control of your supports. If you decide our service isn't the right fit or your circumstances change, you have the right to end the Service Agreement. We ask for [X] days' notice in the agreement. The NDIS gives participants full freedom to change providers. We'll respect your decision and even help with a transition if needed.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: Why should I choose your service over others?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> We believe what sets [Your Org] apart is our commitment to person-centered care and reliability. We are not a huge impersonal company – when you join us, you get a small, dedicated team that knows you well. You'll have a consistent point of contact for any questions, and we really get to know your preferences. We also have clinical oversight. In short, we combine the resources of a professional organization with the heart of a family business.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: Okay, what are the next steps if I want to proceed?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> Great! The next step would be to schedule an in-person meeting or a longer intake call so we can develop a detailed plan together. We'll also prepare a Service Agreement for you to review. I will also send you an email today with my contact details, a summary of what we discussed, and the list of any documents that might be useful to have.</p>

                            <p><span class="highlight">Scenario Overview:</span> Here, a family member, guardian, or advocate of the participant is the one calling. For example, a parent might call about services for their adult child, or a son/daughter calls on behalf of an elderly parent with disability. In some cases, the participant might not be able to speak for themselves easily, or they might simply prefer their loved one handle inquiries.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Special Considerations:</span> When a third party is calling, you have to balance including them and respecting the participant's autonomy. Always ascertain whether the participant is aware of this inquiry and has given permission. Family callers often have their own concerns: they want to ensure their loved one will be safe, well-cared for, and respected. They may ask a lot of detailed questions and can sometimes be anxious or protective – this is natural. Show empathy for their perspective. If appropriate, encourage that the participant be involved in planning as much as possible.</p>

                                <li><span class="highlight">Gather Info:</span> Get the participant's details and needs. Listen to any red flags or special requirements they mention.</li>
                                <li><span class="highlight">Plan Next Steps with Inclusion:</span> Suggest meeting with the participant and family if possible.</li>
                                <li><span class="highlight">Boundary Setting:</span> If needed, gently clarify privacy boundaries. Offer to schedule a 3-way call or meeting.</li>

                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> Yes, absolutely – we often work with family members or advocates during the intake process. First, may I have your name and your relationship to [Participant]? We're very happy to have your involvement. We will of course want [Participant] to be as involved as possible in decisions, but we know how vital family support is. We can definitely discuss and start arrangements through you.</p>

                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> We have experience supporting clients who have communication difficulties or cognitive impairments. Our approach is to get to know how your family member communicates – whether it's through certain behaviors, non-verbal cues, or using assistive communication devices. We often consult with family to learn the individual's likes/dislikes, routines and triggers. Every support plan is very personalized. We also implement regular care notes and communication logs. Regarding safety: all our staff are trained to be attentive and gentle, and to watch for any signs of discomfort or issues.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: Will I be kept informed about what's going on?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> With the participant's consent, yes, we can keep you in the loop regularly. We can arrange updates in a way that works for everyone – for example, a brief weekly email or a quick call to you. At the outset, we'll ask [Participant] and you about communication preferences. Many families appreciate being informed of progress or any issues, and we're happy to do that. We just balance it with the participant's privacy and independence.</p>
                            
                            <p><span class="highlight">Q: What if my family member doesn't want support on a given day, or refuses the worker?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="highlight">A:</span> We understand that can happen. If [Participant] is having a day where they refuse service, our staff are trained not to force anything. We'll try gentle encouragement or offer alternate activities, but ultimately we respect the person's wishes. As for not liking a particular support worker: we take careful matching steps to avoid this, but if it does occur, please let us know immediately. We will not be offended – we will simply assign someone else who might be a better fit.</p>
