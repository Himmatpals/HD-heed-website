          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “Hi. I’m okay, thanks. I wanted to see what help I can get at home.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Absolutely. Before we dive in, do you prefer I call you [Preferred Name]? And are you comfortable to chat now?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “Yes, call me [Preferred Name]. I have time now.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Great. First, a couple of quick checks so we set things up correctly: is your plan self-managed, plan-managed, or NDIA-managed?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “[Plan type].”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Thanks. And what are the main things you’d like help with over the next few months?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “Mainly personal care in the mornings, some meal prep, and getting out once or twice a week.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Perfect. Do you have any current providers (like OT, physio, or a different support worker service) that we should be aware of so we coordinate?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “I see an OT monthly, and I used to have a worker once a week but it wasn’t consistent.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Got it. We’ll make sure not to duplicate and will ask your permission to touch base with your OT if needed. Any safety considerations at home—falls risk, allergies, or transfer notes?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “I use a walker and I’m a bit unsteady in the bathroom.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Thanks for letting me know. We’ll brief our staff with safe techniques and, if you’re happy, ask the OT for any transfer guidance. In terms of timing, which days and times suit you best?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “Mornings are best—say 9 to 11 AM on weekdays. Outings could be Tuesdays or Thursdays.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “That works. We’ll aim for a small, consistent team so you see familiar faces. We’ll also send your roster a week ahead and text you about any changes. For admin: we’ll prepare a simple service agreement outlining hours and costs within NDIS price limits. We can go through it together—no surprises.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “Sounds good. I get anxious about budgets.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Totally understandable. We’ll plan conservative hours initially, monitor usage, and adjust if needed so your supports stretch across the plan year. You’ll stay fully in control.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “Okay. What’s next?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Next, I’ll propose a starter schedule (e.g., Mon–Fri mornings 2 hrs, and a 2-hr community access mid-week), email a draft agreement, and—if you agree—book your first visit. After 2–3 weeks, we’ll check in and tweak anything that’s not perfect.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “Great. Let’s do that.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Brilliant. I’ll send everything today and we’ll get you started. Thanks for your time, [Preferred Name]!”</p>

            <div>
              <p><em>“Dad is hard of hearing—will he still be included?”</em><br>
              Yes. We’ll speak clearly, use speakerphone or captions if needed, and check in directly with him. We’ll involve him in key choices at every step.</p>

              <p><em>“We don’t want to disrupt current therapy.”</em><br>
              We’ll keep OT/Physio as-is and focus on daily living and companionship. We coordinate with therapists to follow their guidance.</p>

              <p><em>“I manage the logistics—can you contact me first?”</em><br>
              Absolutely. We’ll record you as the primary contact for scheduling/updates, while ensuring your dad’s consent and involvement.</p>

              <p><em>“Will this fit the budget?”</em><br>
              We’ll plan hours within Core funding and monitor usage. If we need to adjust, we’ll do it together to protect essentials.</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Hello, this is [Name] from [Your Organization]. I’m looking to speak with [Family Member Name] – I was told you’re the best contact regarding [Participant Name]’s NDIS supports?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Yes, that’s me. I’m [Participant Name]’s daughter. Thanks for calling.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Thank you for reaching out on [Participant Name]’s behalf. How are you both doing today?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “We’re doing alright. My dad (Participant) is here with me. He’s a bit hard of hearing, so I tend to handle the phone conversations.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “I understand. Hi [Participant Name] (speaking a bit louder and clearer)! I’m [Name] from [Org]. I’m talking with your daughter to make sure we arrange the supports you need. How are you today?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span> (in background): “Oh, hello! I’m okay, thank you.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “He can hear you on speaker now. He knows we’re arranging some help for him.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Great, I’ll continue to chat with both of you. So, I understand [Participant Name] has an NDIS plan, and you’re helping to organize his services. Could you tell me a bit about what prompted you to contact us and what supports you’re looking for?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Sure. My dad had a stroke last year. He’s on the NDIS and currently has some physio and occupational therapy, but we’re looking to get him a regular support worker. I’m worried about him being alone most of the day when I’m at work. He could use help with meals and just someone around in case he needs anything. His speech isn’t great and his right side is weak.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Got it. Thank you for the background. So he’s already receiving physio and OT – is that through another provider or directly through NDIS?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “It’s through another clinic. They’re doing a good job with therapy, so we’d like to keep that as is. What we really need from you is more on the daily living side – kind of like in-home care and companionship.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Absolutely, we can cover that. We have support workers who can come to your dad’s home and help with daily tasks (like preparing lunch, light housekeeping, etc.) and also just be there as a companion, maybe take him for a walk or to the local park if he’s up for it. We can tailor the activities to what he enjoys and what keeps him safe.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span> (background): “I do get lonely sometimes, yes.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “He used to be very active socially, so it’s been hard.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “I understand. Social connection is so important. We’ll definitely aim to match him with a support worker who shares some of his interests. For example, what does your dad like? Any hobbies or topics he enjoys?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “He loves gardening and watching cricket. He can’t garden like he used to, but he enjoys sitting outside.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “That’s great to know. We actually have a support worker in our team, [Support Worker Name], who is an avid cricket fan and is skilled in helping with light gardening tasks. Someone like that might be a good fit to accompany your dad, talk cricket, maybe help him water the plants or just get some fresh air outside safely.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Oh, that sounds promising! Dad, what do you think? Someone to talk cricket with you?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “That would be nice.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Wonderful. Now, let’s talk logistics for a moment. [Participant Name], your NDIS plan – do you know if it’s self-managed or plan-managed, or NDIA-managed? Basically, who pays the bills from the plan?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “It’s agency-managed. The NDIS pays providers directly. He doesn’t handle any of that.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Thanks, that means we’ll just make service bookings in the system and claim payments directly. No worry there. And do you happen to know how many hours or funding is allocated for his daily support? I want to ensure we plan within his budget.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “He has about $20k a year in core supports available. We were thinking of starting with maybe 3 hours a day, Monday to Friday, around midday to afternoon.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “That sounds reasonable. Rough math, that should be sustainable with $20k for quite a few months, and then plans usually renew annually. We can fine-tune it. We’ll help you keep track so it doesn’t overrun the budget. And if we find he needs more or less, we can adjust.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Okay, great. Another thing: I usually coordinate everything for him. Is it alright if I continue to be the main contact with you? I’ll make sure he’s informed and involved in decisions, but it’s just easier for scheduling and so on.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Of course. We appreciate having a dedicated family contact—it often makes communication smoother. We will involve your dad in any key discussions (since it’s about him), but for day-to-day things like scheduling or updates, I’m happy to call or email you. If at any time your dad wants to speak directly with us or have a one-on-one meeting, we can do that too.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Email works for me for records, but phone or text for anything urgent or scheduling is fine too.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Noted. I’ll get all your contacts. Next, I’d like to schedule a home visit to meet you both in person. During that visit, we can introduce a potential support worker (like the cricket-fan I mentioned) to see if it’s a good fit. We’ll also go over a service agreement—that’s a plain-English document listing what we’ll do and our obligations. Would you be comfortable with that?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Yes, that’s fine. I’d appreciate seeing things in writing.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Perfect. I can email you a draft before the meeting. Is there a day next week that works for a visit? I can bring that support worker to introduce.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Wednesday afternoon is good. I can be there by 3 PM.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Okay, Wednesday at 3 PM. Does that suit you too, [Participant Name]?”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “Yes.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Great! We’ll be there. If you could gather any relevant therapy notes—like transfer techniques from OT—it helps our worker support your dad safely.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Yes, the OT gave us a sheet. I’ll have it ready.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “Perfect. Feel free to think of any other questions. Our goal is to support your dad and make both of you feel confident and comfortable. You’ve done a fantastic job so far—we’re here to share the load.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Thank you. I’m hopeful this will help him and me.”</p>

          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “I’m sure it will. I’ll send an email now with my contact info, the draft service agreement, and the appointment confirmation. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up before then.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Family Member</span>: “Will do. Thanks for your help today.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Participant</span>: “Thank you.”</p>
          <p><span class="who">Intake</span>: “You’re both very welcome. Take care, and see you soon.”</p>

    <!-- Quick Facts -->
    <div class="panel">
      <h3>Quick facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Behaviours are communication. We look for <em>triggers</em> and <em>what works</em> to keep everyone safe.</li>
        <li>If restrictive practices exist (e.g., PRN medication, lap belt), confirm they are authorised and documented.</li>
        <li>Keep the team small and consistent; brief staff thoroughly before first shift.</li>
        <li>Plan for crisis: de-escalation steps, who to call, and when to escalate.</li>

          <li>Other professionals: psychologist, psychiatrist, GP, behaviour practitioner.</li>
          <li>Environment: home/day program/school; sensory factors to consider.</li>

        <p><strong>Intake (Clinical):</strong> Hello, this is [Your Name] from [Organisation]. I’m calling about supports for [Participant]. Is now okay?</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Yes, thank you. It’s a bit stressful, to be honest.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> I understand. This is a judgement-free chat. I’d like to learn what works for [Participant] and how we can keep everyone safe. Could you tell me what a tough moment looks like and what usually sets it off?</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Transitions and noise. He might yell, throw things, or hit. It happens a few times a week.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Thank you. What helps most when that starts?</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Space, removing things he could throw, and talking calmly about trains.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Great—space, safety, and a favourite topic. Do you have a behaviour plan and any PRN medication protocol?</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Yes, a psychologist wrote a Positive Behaviour Support Plan. PRN is included as a last resort.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> That’s helpful. With your permission, I’ll request the plan and any recent incident notes so we align with it. Are any other restrictive practices in use?</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> No physical restraint. Only PRN if needed.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Understood. For staffing, would 2:1 ever be needed, or is trained 1:1 fine?</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> 1:1 is usually fine if the person is trained and calm.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> We’ll assign experienced staff and brief them before attendance. We’ll start with a casual meet-and-greet so trust can build. How does Thursday 3 PM at home (backyard with the train set) sound?</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Perfect.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Great. I’ll send a summary, collect the PBSP and authorisations, and bring a short crisis plan template we can finalise together. You’ll have a direct number for urgent issues. Does that feel okay?</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Yes, that’s reassuring. Thank you.</p>

  <h2>8) Disengaged or Hard-to-Reach Clients</h2>
  <p class="intro">
    Some participants may be reluctant to engage, have had poor experiences with providers, or simply
    find it overwhelming to talk about supports. This script provides guidance on gently opening
    conversation, leaving the door open, and balancing persistence with respect.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    Caller Type & Role: Intake Officer reaching out to a participant who has been referred but has not
    responded well to previous contacts, or who seems disengaged in the intake process.
  </div>

  <h3>Context</h3>
  <p>
    Disengagement might occur because of anxiety, previous negative experiences, cultural barriers, or
    simple overwhelm. The aim is to <strong>acknowledge</strong> this without pressure, reassure them that
    support is optional and participant-led, and provide easy avenues to reconnect when they’re ready.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Information to Gather (if possible)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Whether they are aware of the referral and open to hearing about supports.</li>
    <li>If there are preferred communication methods (SMS, email, calls, in-person).</li>
    <li>Whether they want a family member, support coordinator, or friend involved.</li>
    <li>Any small goals or immediate needs they are comfortable sharing (even one thing is progress).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common Concerns & Responses</h3>
  <details>
    <summary>“I don’t want to talk right now.”</summary>
    <div class="script">
      <p><strong>Response:</strong> “That’s completely fine. I understand this can feel like a lot.
      I’ll step back now. Just so you know, I’ll try again next week, or you can call or text me anytime
      if you prefer to start the conversation on your terms.”</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>“I’ve had bad experiences with providers before.”</summary>
    <div class="script">
      <p><strong>Response:</strong> “I’m sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, that does happen
      sometimes. With us, you are always in control — you decide what supports you want and when.
      Even if you’d like to just start with one small thing and see how it goes, we’re here to work at
      your pace.”</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>“I don’t want to commit to anything right now.”</summary>
    <div class="script">
      <p><strong>Response:</strong> “That’s absolutely okay. We can just have a brief chat to introduce
      ourselves, no strings attached. If you decide later you’d like to try, we’ll be ready to support you.
      The choice is always yours.”</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <h3>Suggested Next Steps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Leave a gentle voicemail or SMS that is <em>non-demanding</em> and invites them to reach out when ready.</li>
    <li>Offer to include a trusted person (family member, SC) in future calls if it makes them more comfortable.</li>
    <li>Keep records minimal until engagement improves — respect privacy.</li>
    <li>Set a diary reminder for follow-up in 1–2 weeks, but never bombard with calls.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Conversation Example</h3>
  <div class="script">
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Hi [Participant Name], it’s [Your Name] from [Org]. We received a
    referral to see if you’d like any NDIS support. There’s no pressure — I just wanted to say hello and
    let you know I’m here if you’d like to chat.”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “I don’t really want to talk about it.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “That’s okay, I hear you. I don’t want to push. I’ll leave my number with
    you — if you feel like chatting later, even just to ask a question, you can call or text me anytime.
    Otherwise, I’ll give you another quick call next week just to check in. Does that sound alright?”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “Yeah, I guess that’s fine.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Perfect, I’ll keep it brief. Thanks for your time today — take care.”</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Voicemail Example</h3>
  <div class="script">
    <p>“Hi [Participant Name], this is [Your Name] from [Org]. We got a referral to see if you’d like any
    NDIS support. This isn’t urgent, and I don’t want to bug you — just wanted to introduce myself. I’m
    here to help you with anything that might make life easier or more enjoyable, if you’re interested.
    I’ll try calling you again next week, or you can call or even text me at this number anytime. No
    pressure at all. Have a great day.”</p>
  </div>

  <h3>FAQs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Do I have to give all my details now?</strong> – No, you can share as little or as much as you’re comfortable with. We can always fill in details later.</li>
    <li><strong>What if I never call back?</strong> – That’s your choice. We’ll only follow up gently a couple of times, then leave it in your hands.</li>
    <li><strong>Can I bring someone else into the call?</strong> – Absolutely. You can ask a family member, support coordinator, or friend to join or even lead the call if you like.</li>

  <h2>9) Clients Transitioning from Another Provider</h2>
  <p class="intro">
    Switching providers can be stressful. This script helps you welcome the participant, understand why they’re
    moving, and set up a smooth, zero-gap transition with clear communication and reliable rosters.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Caller Type & Role:</strong> Intake Coordinator or Service Coordinator speaking with a participant who is leaving their current provider and moving to your service.
  </div>

  <h3>Context</h3>
  <p>
    Participants change providers for many reasons: relocation, poor reliability, staff mismatch, or new goals.
    Acknowledge their experience, avoid criticising the previous provider, and focus on continuity, consistency,
    and trust. Aim for <em>no gaps</em> in support and a clear start date.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Information to Gather</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Reason(s) for the change (only if they’re comfortable sharing).</li>
    <li>Which supports they currently receive (hours, days, tasks) and what they want to keep or change.</li>
    <li>Final date with previous provider and any notice period in their service agreement.</li>
    <li>Plan management details (self / plan-managed / agency-managed) and any existing service bookings.</li>
    <li>Reports, routines, or plans that should be handed over (therapy notes, behaviour plans, preferences).</li>
    <li>Any worker preferences (gender, language, skills) and pet/home considerations.</li>
    <li>Key contacts: plan manager, support coordinator, family nominee.</li>

  <details>
    <summary>“Do I have to deal with my old provider?”</summary>
    <div class="script">
      <p><strong>Response:</strong> “Notice is usually best coming from you, but I can draft the message. We’ll also

  <details>
    <summary>“How do I know your service will be better?”</summary>
    <div class="script">
      <p><strong>Response:</strong> “You’ll help choose your workers, and we keep rosters consistent. We confirm your
      schedule in advance and communicate any changes immediately. If a match isn’t right, we’ll adjust quickly.”</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <h3>Suggested Next Steps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a simple transition plan: <em>old provider end date → new provider start date</em> (no overlap billing).</li>
    <li>Draft/send new service agreement (include start date, hours, tasks, goals, rates).</li>
    <li>Coordinate with plan manager/SC to close old and open new service bookings.</li>
    <li>Collect key handover info (routines, risk notes, therapy plans) with consent.</li>
    <li>Assign a small, consistent worker team; offer a quick meet-and-greet before day one.</li>
    <li>Schedule a check-in after Week 1 and after Month 1 to confirm things are working.</li>

    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “I’m okay. I’m leaving my old provider and hoping this goes smoother.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “We’ll make the switch easy. If it’s okay, can you tell me what wasn’t working and what you’d like us to do differently?”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “They kept changing workers and missing shifts. I want consistent mornings for personal care.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Got it. Reliability and consistency are your priorities. We’ll schedule the same two workers for your mornings, and we’ll confirm your roster weekly. If anything changes, you’ll get a text or call straight away.”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “That would be great.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “What’s your last day with your current provider?”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “Friday.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Perfect. We can start Saturday at 9am with [Worker 1]. If you’re comfortable, [Worker 1] can pop in for a 10-minute hello on Friday so Saturday feels familiar.”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “Yes, I’d like to meet them first.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Great. Any routines we should know? Coffee before shower, pet care, house rules?”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “Coffee first, then shower. And please feed my cat before you start cleaning.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Noted: coffee first, then shower; feed the cat first on arrival. Any worker preferences?”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “Female workers, please.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Absolutely. We’ll assign [Worker 1] and [Worker 2], both experienced and comfortable with pets. About the admin: have you given notice to your old provider?”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “Yes, I told them Friday is the last day.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Great. I’ll coordinate with your plan manager to close their service booking on Friday and open ours from Saturday. I’ll send you our service agreement today with the schedule we discussed. We can review it together before you sign.”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “Please email it. I’ll read it tonight.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Will do. Last thing—any goals you’d like us to add beyond mornings? For example, getting back to your community garden?”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “Yes, I’d like help getting there again once things settle.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Love that. We’ll add ‘community garden outing’ as a goal and plan a fortnightly session once mornings are running smoothly. I’ll also check transport options.”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “Thank you. This sounds promising.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “My pleasure. To recap: meet-and-greet Friday 9:30am with [Worker 1]; services start Saturday 9am; consistent morning roster; I’ll email the agreement and confirm the service booking. We’ll check in after the first week. Anything I missed?”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “No, that’s everything. Thanks.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “You’re welcome. We’re excited to support you.”</p>

  <h2>10) Hospital Discharge / Urgent Safety Intake</h2>
  <p class="intro">
    This script supports urgent intakes for participants leaving hospital or experiencing a safety crisis.
    The priority is rapid response, safe transition, and reassurance. The intake officer must balance speed
    with accuracy, gathering essential details for immediate service delivery.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Caller Type & Role:</strong> Intake Coordinator or Clinical Lead speaking with a participant, family member,
    hospital social worker, or discharge planner.
  </div>

  <h3>Context</h3>
  <p>
    Urgent referrals often arise when a participant is about to be discharged without adequate support at home,
    or when their living situation becomes unsafe (e.g., carer breakdown, housing crisis). The call must establish
    immediate needs (same-day or next-day support) while setting up medium-term arrangements (care plans,
    therapy referrals, allied health).
  </p>

  <h3>Key Information to Gather</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Discharge date/time or crisis timeline (“leaving hospital today at 3 PM”).</li>
    <li>What supports are required urgently (e.g., personal care, nursing, medication administration, meal prep).</li>
    <li>Risk factors: falls, pressure injuries, medication non-compliance, unsafe environment.</li>
    <li>Participant’s NDIS plan details (funding categories available, plan manager/SC contact).</li>
    <li>Hospital or referrer contact person (nurse, social worker) for clinical handover.</li>
    <li>Participant’s home setup: stairs, equipment, need for equipment hire (e.g., hospital bed, commode).</li>
    <li>Family or informal supports available (who else is at home?).</li>
    <li>Emergency contacts and escalation process.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common Concerns & Helpful Responses</h3>
  <details>
    <summary>“I’m being discharged today but I don’t have support arranged.”</summary>
    <div class="script">
      <p><strong>Response:</strong> “We’ll prioritise your case. We can organise a support worker or nurse to meet you
      at home today, even within a few hours. We’ll then build a longer-term schedule with you so you’re safe and supported.”</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>“Will the NDIS cover urgent supports?”</summary>
    <div class="script">
      <p><strong>Response:</strong> “Yes, as long as it aligns with your plan categories. We’ll coordinate with your
      plan manager or support coordinator to activate the right funding immediately. Our admin team is used to
      processing urgent service bookings.”</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>“What if I need equipment at home (bed, hoist, commode)?”</summary>
    <div class="script">
      <p><strong>Response:</strong> “We can arrange equipment hire quickly through our supplier partners. If you need a
      hospital bed or mobility aid, we’ll have it delivered within 24–48 hours.”</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <h3>Suggested Next Steps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Secure urgent staff availability (personal care worker, RN if required).</li>
    <li>Arrange hospital handover and collect discharge summary.</li>
    <li>Confirm NDIS service booking with plan manager/SC for immediate cover.</li>
    <li>Arrange transport home if needed (ambulance, patient transport, support worker vehicle).</li>
    <li>Check for urgent risks at home (falls, meds, skin integrity) and escalate if unsafe.</li>
    <li>Document urgent plan and schedule a review within 48 hours.</li>

    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “Yes, it’s Bright Plan Management, email plan@brightpm.com.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Perfect. I’ll contact them right now. We’ll also call the hospital nurse for a quick
    clinical handover. Do you have any equipment needs at home, like a shower chair or commode?”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “I’ll need a commode chair.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “We can arrange hire today so it’s delivered urgently. Finally, can I confirm your
    home address and any family or friends who will be there this evening?”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “[Gives address and says they live alone.]”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Thank you. We’ll make sure you’re not alone without support. To recap: hospital
    discharge at 3 PM; our support worker and nurse will arrive by 4 PM; equipment hire for commode chair arranged;
    I’ll coordinate funding with your plan manager. We’ll review again tomorrow morning. Does that cover
    everything urgent for today?”</p>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “Yes, thank you so much.”</p>
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “You’re welcome. We’ll handle the details so you can focus on settling back at home
    safely. See you later today.”</p>

  <h2>11) Participants with Complex Family Dynamics</h2>
  <p class="intro">
    This script guides intake when family conflict, disputes, or differing opinions are involved.
    The intake officer must remain neutral, professional, and participant-focused, while still
    engaging family members respectfully where appropriate.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Caller Type & Role:</strong> Intake Coordinator, speaking with both the participant and one or more
    family members or carers who may have conflicting views on support needs, service use, or goals.
  </div>

  <h3>Context</h3>
  <p>
    Families can sometimes disagree on what supports are needed or how they should be delivered.
    The participant may feel overshadowed by family opinions, or carers may feel the participant
    is not making safe choices. The NDIS principle of <em>choice and control</em> means the participant’s
    voice is central, but family must also be heard respectfully to maintain trust and safety.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Information to Gather</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Who the primary decision-maker is (participant themselves, or if they have a nominee/guardian).</li>
    <li>Any safety risks (domestic violence, carer stress, participant neglect).</li>
    <li>What each party’s main concerns are (participant vs. family).</li>
    <li>What the participant wants in their own words — keep their preferences central.</li>
    <li>What the family members are asking for (often more respite, supervision, or involvement).</li>
    <li>Whether legal arrangements are in place (e.g., guardianship, power of attorney).</li>
    <li>Points of agreement (to build on) and points of conflict (to manage carefully).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common Concerns & Helpful Responses</h3>
  <details>
    <summary>“My family doesn’t agree with me about the help I want.”</summary>
    <div class="script">
      <p><strong>Response:</strong> “Thank you for sharing that. Our role is to listen to you first and make sure
      the supports reflect your wishes. At the same time, we want your family to feel included.
      We’ll try to find a balance, but ultimately, you are the decision-maker.”</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>“I don’t think my brother is safe living alone. He needs more care than he realises.”</summary>
    <div class="script">
      <p><strong>Response:</strong> “I hear your concerns. Safety is very important. We’ll do a proper risk
      assessment, and we’ll also check what [Participant Name] feels comfortable with.
      If risks are identified, we’ll put strategies in place together.”</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>“I don’t want my parents involved — I just want to make my own choices.”</summary>
    <div class="script">
      <p><strong>Response:</strong> “You have that right under the NDIS. We will respect your independence.
      If you’d like, we can keep communication directly between you and us, and not involve family unless
      you give permission. We want you to feel in control.”</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <h3>Suggested Next Steps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Clarify decision-making authority (participant, nominee, or guardian).</li>
    <li>Document participant’s wishes clearly in intake notes.</li>
    <li>If risks are raised by family, complete risk screening and escalate if necessary.</li>
    <li>Offer family involvement where participant consents, but respect boundaries.</li>
    <li>Schedule a joint meeting (participant + family) if appropriate, with a neutral facilitator.</li>
    <li>Ensure service agreement reflects participant’s wishes — not solely family demands.</li>
    <li>Communicate transparently with all parties to reduce tension and build trust.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Conversation — Full Script</h3>
  <div class="script">
    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Hello, this is [Your Name] from [Organisation]. Thank you both for joining this call.
    I understand there may be different views about supports. My role is to listen to everyone, but especially
    to [Participant Name], since the NDIS is about their choice and control.”</p>

    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “I just want someone to help me a few hours a week with shopping and cleaning.
    That’s all I need.”</p>

    <p><strong>Parent:</strong> “But that’s not enough! You forget your medication and you’ve fallen before.
    You need someone every day.”</p>

    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Thank you for raising that. Falls and medication are important safety issues.
    [Participant Name], how do you feel about having support with those things?”</p>

    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “I don’t want someone here every day. Maybe just a reminder for meds,
    but I can manage the rest.”</p>

    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Okay, I hear that you want independence, but you’re open to some reminders.
    One option is a worker visiting a few times a week, plus setting up a pill organiser or tech reminder system.
    That way, you keep independence but stay safe. Would that feel better?”</p>

    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> “Yes, that sounds okay.”</p>

    <p><strong>Parent:</strong> “I’d prefer more, but if at least there are reminders, I feel safer too.”</p>

    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Great, that sounds like a compromise we can build on. Let’s put that in the plan:
    shopping and cleaning help, plus medication reminders two or three times a week.
    We can review later if more support is needed. Does that work for both of you?”</p>

    <p><strong>Participant & Parent:</strong> “Yes.”</p>

    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Perfect. I’ll draft the service agreement with those details, and we can always
    revisit it. Thank you both for working through this together.”</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Mini Checklist (Internal)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☑ Clarify legal authority for decisions.</li>
    <li>☑ Document participant’s stated wishes.</li>
    <li>☑ Record family concerns and any risks flagged.</li>
    <li>☑ Seek compromise solutions that protect safety while respecting autonomy.</li>
    <li>☑ Update BSP or risk plan if family raises valid concerns.</li>
    <li>☑ Schedule review meeting for ongoing family dynamics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>FAQs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What if family and participant disagree?</strong> — The participant’s choice is central, unless legal guardianship applies.</li>
    <li><strong>Can family override the participant’s wishes?</strong> — Only if they are the appointed guardian or nominee.</li>
    <li><strong>What if family conflict escalates?</strong> — Pause intake, ensure participant safety, and escalate for clinical/social work review.</li>
    <li><strong>Do you involve family in all communication?</strong> — Only with participant consent, otherwise communication is direct with the participant.</li>

  <h2>12) Paediatric Clients (Under 7, ECEI Transition)</h2>
  <p class="intro">
    Use this script when supporting a family whose child is moving from the Early Childhood (ECEI) approach
    to the standard NDIS pathway (around age 7), or when a young child is newly entering NDIS supports.
    Keep it warm, simple, and family-focused.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Caller Type & Role:</strong> Early Childhood Intake Coordinator / Key Worker speaking with a parent/guardian of a child under 7 (or recently turned 7) to ensure a smooth transition and continuous supports.
  </div>

  <h3>Context</h3>
  <p>
    Families may feel worried about losing support or “starting over” as their child ages out of ECEI.
    Your goals: reassure continuity, explain roles (LAC/Planner vs providers), and co-design a clear plan
    for therapy, routines, and school collaboration. Keep explanations plain and practical.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Information to Gather</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Child’s current supports (speech/OT/physio/psych), frequency, and what’s working well.</li>
    <li>Any ECEI reports/plans to carry forward (ask to share copies if available).</li>
    <li>Main goals for the next 6–12 months (e.g., communication, play/peer skills, self-care, school routines).</li>
    <li>School/preschool details, teacher contacts, and best times for therapy around school.</li>
    <li>Parent’s preferred involvement model (coaching in-session, separate parent sessions, or both).</li>
    <li>Any upcoming reviews or plan dates; who the new LAC/Planner is (if known).</li>
    <li>Funding categories available now (e.g., Improved Daily Living, Improved Relationships) and priorities.</li>
    <li>Preferred therapy location(s): home, school, clinic, community.</li>
    <li>Any sensory, medical, or safety considerations (allergies, seizures, elopement risk).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common Concerns & Helpful Responses</h3>
  <details>
    <summary>“We’re losing our ECEI team — I’m scared we’ll have to start from scratch.”</summary>
    <div class="script">
      <p><strong>Response:</strong> “That’s a very common worry. You’re not starting over. We’ll carry your child’s goals and strategies forward. With your permission, we can use the ECEI reports and speak with them for a warm handover. We’ll keep what works and add to it.”</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>“Will therapy stay play-based? I don’t want it to be too formal.”</summary>
    <div class="script">
      <p><strong>Response:</strong> “Yes — we stay play-based and child-led. As your child grows, we may add small structure when they’re ready, but sessions will still feel like play and build real-life skills.”</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>“Who do I call now for plan questions — ECEI or someone else?”</summary>
    <div class="script">
      <p><strong>Response:</strong> “After ECEI, your main NDIS contact is usually a Local Area Coordinator (LAC) or an NDIA Planner. We can join you on a call with them if you like, and our therapists provide reports to support funding at reviews.”</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>“How will therapy fit around school?”</summary>
    <div class="script">
      <p><strong>Response:</strong> “We can visit at school (with permission), or schedule after-school sessions. We can also share strategies with the teacher so everyone uses the same approach.”</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <h3>Suggested Next Steps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Request consent to collect ECEI reports and coordinate a warm handover with previous practitioners.</li>
    <li>Confirm new LAC/Planner details; offer to join an introductory call if helpful.</li>
    <li>Co-design a 12-week starter plan (goals, frequency, locations, school collaboration plan).</li>
    <li>Map sessions around school/family routines; plan travel/attendance requirements early.</li>
    <li>Set review cadence (e.g., 8–12 weeks) with brief progress summaries for parents and LAC.</li>
    <li>Document safety info (e.g., allergies, seizure plans) and share with the therapy team.</li>
    <li>Prepare a simple “home routine toolkit” (visuals, schedules, sensory ideas) for parents.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Conversation — Full Script</h3>
  <div class="script">
    <p><strong>Intake (Key Worker):</strong> “Hello [Parent Name], I’m [Your Name] from [Organisation]. I’ll help with [Child Name]’s transition from the ECEI program into ongoing NDIS supports. How are you today?”</p>

    <p><strong>Parent:</strong> “Hi. I’m okay, just nervous about all the changes now that he’s turning 7.”</p>

    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Totally understandable. You’ve had a great early team — and we’ll keep that momentum going. With your permission, we’ll use their reports and continue what works, so you’re not starting over.”</p>

    <p><strong>Parent:</strong> “That would help. He’s been doing speech and OT fortnightly. Speech has helped a lot, but strangers still struggle to understand him.”</p>

    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Thank you — that’s useful context. If he can tolerate it, we can move to weekly speech to keep building clarity. We can also have the therapist visit school occasionally (if the school agrees) to align strategies with the teacher.”</p>

    <p><strong>Parent:</strong> “School involvement would be great. He starts Year 1 soon and group time is hard.”</p>

    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “We can support that. Our OT can create a simple sensory and routines plan for class — things like movement/quiet breaks, visual schedules, and a calm corner. Would you like us to coordinate a quick meeting with the teacher?”</p>

    <p><strong>Parent:</strong> “Yes, please.”</p>

    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Perfect. Let’s set goals for the next few months: 1) clearer speech for everyday needs, 2) more comfortable group participation, and 3) building independence with dressing and toothbrushing. Does that match your priorities?”</p>

    <p><strong>Parent:</strong> “Yes — those are exactly it.”</p>

    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Great. We’ll keep sessions playful and short enough to keep him engaged. We can start with weekly speech and weekly OT. For independence at home, we’ll coach you on visuals and small step-by-step routines. We’ll also share short video tips if you like.”</p>

    <p><strong>Parent:</strong> “Video tips would be handy.”</p>

    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “Done. About NDIS admin — after ECEI, your LAC/Planner becomes your plan contact. If you want, I can join your first call so it’s less stressful. Our team will also provide progress notes for reviews.”</p>

    <p><strong>Parent:</strong> “That would be great — I get overwhelmed with the paperwork.”</p>

    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “We’ll keep it simple. I’ll send a summary of today, the session plan, and a draft service agreement. We’ll also request your OK to talk to school and your past ECEI team for a warm handover. How does starting next week sound?”</p>

    <p><strong>Parent:</strong> “Next week works. Thank you for making this easy.”</p>

    <p><strong>Intake:</strong> “You’re welcome. You’re doing an amazing job — we’ll keep building on your child’s strengths together.”</p>
