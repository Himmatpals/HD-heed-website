      <h2>1) Standard Participant Intake (Self or Plan Managed)</h2>
      <div class="callout"><span class="badge">Caller</span> Intake Officer (admin/clinical). <span class="badge">Context</span> First-contact welcome + gather details.</div>
      <h3>Key Information to Gather</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Participant details, NDIS #, plan dates, management type (self/plan-managed + plan manager contacts).</li>
        <li>Supports sought, goals, immediate needs/preferences, key people (SC), safety/health considerations.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Common Concerns & Responses</h3>
      <div class="script"><pre>Concern: “Will the NDIS cover all these services? I’m worried about cost.”
Response: “Your NDIS plan will fund the supports we provide, so there shouldn’t be any out-of-pocket cost for you for the approved services. We’ll make sure to stick within your plan’s budget. Part of our job is to manage the billing with NDIS or your plan manager, so you can focus on the support itself, not the payments.”

Concern: “I’m new to this and not sure what information you need or what happens next.”
Response: “No problem at all. I’ll walk you through everything step by step. In this call, I’ll ask a few questions just to understand your needs and get basic details. Then I can explain what services we offer and how we can help. If I mention anything you’re unsure about, please let me know and I’ll happily explain. We know NDIS has its own language sometimes, so we try to keep it simple and clear.”

Concern: “I have a plan manager. Do I need to handle any of the payments or paperwork?”
Response: “Since you’re plan-managed, your plan manager will take care of paying invoices and claiming funds back from the NDIA. That means you won’t have to do the financial paperwork – we will send our invoices directly to them. I will note your plan manager’s details and coordinate with them, so you can just focus on your supports.”

Concern: “How soon can we start the services?”
Response: “We’ll work with you to get things started as soon as possible. After this intake conversation, the next step is usually to set up an initial meeting or assessment with the relevant team member (like a therapist or support coordinator). We can often do that within a week or two, depending on your availability. If you have urgent needs, please let me know and we’ll do our best to prioritize them.”</pre></div>
      <h3>Suggested Next Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Overview of relevant services; prepare and send service agreement; arrange initial meet/assessment.</li>
        <li>Send follow-up summary with contacts and appointment details; encourage questions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Scripted Dialogue</h3>
      <div class="script"><pre>Intake: “Hello, this is [Name] calling from [Your Organization]. May I please speak with [Participant Name]?”
Participant: “Speaking. Hi.”
Intake: “Hi [Participant Name]! How are you today? I’m calling because we received your details as someone who’s interested in our NDIS support services. I wanted to introduce myself and see how we can assist you.”
Participant: “Oh, hi. I’m doing okay, thanks. Yes, I’ve been looking for a support provider.”
Intake: “Great, I’m glad to connect with you. Is now a good time to chat for about 10–15 minutes?”
Participant: “Yes, that’s fine.”
Intake: “Wonderful. First, I’d love to get a bit of an idea of what you’re looking for. I understand you’re an NDIS participant – are you managing the plan yourself or do you have a plan manager?”
Participant: “I have a plan manager who handles the payments.”
Intake: “No problem. That’s good to know. That means your plan manager will take care of invoices and claiming from NDIS, so you won’t have to worry about that part. Could I get the name of the plan management service and maybe an email? That way we can coordinate directly with them.”
Participant: “Sure, I’m with Bright Plan Management. Their email is plan@brightpm.com.”
Intake: “Thank you, I’ve noted that. Now, could you tell me a little about what supports you’re hoping to get? For example, some people need help at home with daily tasks, others are looking for therapy like physio or speech, etc.”
Participant: “I have a spinal injury, so I mainly need help with personal care in the mornings and some physio to build my strength. I’m also interested in having someone help me get out to the shops or appointments occasionally, since I can’t drive.”
Intake: “Got it. So, a mix of personal care and community access support, plus physiotherapy. We can certainly help with those. We have support workers who can assist you at home and also go out with you for errands or social outings. And we have a physiotherapist experienced with mobility and strength exercises for spinal injury clients.”
Participant: “That’s good to hear.”
Intake: “Approx how many days a week were you thinking of support worker help?”
Participant: “Maybe daily in the mornings for the personal care, and once a week for outings.”
Intake: “Alright. We’ll work out a schedule that fits. We’ll also get our physio involved – perhaps one session to assess and then regular sessions as needed. Now, let me grab a few quick details for our records: Your NDIS number (if you have it handy) and your date of birth.”
Participant: “NDIS number is 123456789, and DOB is 5th May 1980.”
Intake: “Thank you. And just to confirm, your plan runs till next June, right? (I see a note that it’s a 12-month plan.)”
Participant: “Yes, June next year.”
Intake: “Perfect. I’ll make sure our services align with that timeframe, and of course, if your plan is renewed or changed, we can adjust. Now, do you have any questions for me at this stage? It’s completely okay if you’re not sure what to ask – I can also outline next steps for you.”
Participant: “Maybe just: how does it work from here? Do we meet in person or…?”
Intake: “Great question. After this call, our next step is usually to set up an in-person meeting or a home visit. For example, I can arrange for our physiotherapist to come meet you, or I can visit along with a senior support worker to make a plan for your daily supports. We’ll discuss your goals in more detail and you can get to know us. During that visit, we’ll also go over a service agreement – that’s the document that outlines what we’ll do and the terms, but I’ll send it to you in advance via email so you can read it comfortably.”
Participant: “Okay, that sounds good.”
Intake: “When would you be available for an initial meeting? Are mornings or afternoons better for you?”
Participant: “Afternoons are better, since mornings are when I need help.”
Intake: “Understood. How about this coming Thursday around 2 PM? I can come with our physio, [Physio Name], to your home. Does that work?”
Participant: “Yes, that should be fine.”
Intake: “Excellent. I’ll penciling that in. We’ll send you a reminder the day before. Now, one more thing: we take a person-centered approach, which means we want you to feel comfortable and in control. If at any point you have concerns or want something done differently, just let us know. Also, if you think of any questions after we hang up – maybe tonight or tomorrow – please don’t hesitate to contact me. My direct number and email will be in the email I send.”
Participant: “Great, thank you. I appreciate that.”
Intake: “You’re very welcome! To recap: we’ll meet Thursday 2 PM at your place, I’ll email you the service agreement and a summary of what we discussed. We’ll start with getting morning personal care in place and some physio sessions. We’ll coordinate with your plan manager for payments, so that’s all taken care of on our end. We’re really looking forward to working with you, [Participant Name].”
Participant: “Thanks, I’m looking forward to getting some help.”
Intake: “We’re happy to help. Take care, and we’ll see you soon!”
Participant: “Thanks, bye.”
Intake: “Bye-bye.”</pre></div>

      <h2>2) Family Member or Next of Kin Calling on Behalf</h2>
      <div class="callout"><span class="badge">Caller</span> Intake Officer. <span class="badge">Context</span> Family/next of kin coordinating with consent.</div>
      <h3>Key Information to Gather</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Relationship/role, participant awareness/consent, participant basics, needs from family view, communication preferences, contact plan.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Common Concerns & Responses</h3>
      <div class="script"><pre>Concern: “My [relative] can’t really speak on the phone or manage this process on their own. Is it okay that I handle these discussions?”
Response: “Yes, absolutely... We’ll always keep [Participant Name] at the center of our planning, but we value your input and assistance.”

Concern: “Do I need any official permission or documents to speak for my [relative]?”
Response: “For the initial intake, no formal paperwork is required to talk generally... We’ll handle any necessary consent forms later in a simple way.”

Concern: “I’m worried about privacy – I want to respect my [relative]’s privacy but also make sure everything is communicated. How do you handle that?”
Response: “We take privacy seriously... We will only discuss details with people they consent to us talking to.”

Concern: “I want to make sure the support is right for [Participant Name]. They had a bad experience before, and I’m protective of them.”
Response: “I completely understand... We want to earn your trust and certainly [Participant Name]’s trust.”</pre></div>
      <h3>Suggested Next Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Say hello to participant if appropriate; schedule joint meeting; arrange consent/nominee paperwork if needed; collect relevant docs; set comms plan.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Scripted Dialogue</h3>
      <div class="script"><pre>Intake: “Hello, this is [Name] from [Your Organization]. I’m looking to speak with [Family Member Name] – I was told you’re the best contact regarding [Participant Name]’s NDIS supports?”
Family Member: “Yes, that’s me. I’m [Participant Name]’s daughter. Thanks for calling.”
Intake: “Thank you for reaching out on [Participant Name]’s behalf. How are you both doing today?”
Family Member: “We’re doing alright. My dad (Participant) is here with me. He’s a bit hard of hearing, so I tend to handle the phone conversations.”
Intake: “I understand. Hi [Participant Name] (speaking a bit louder and clearer)! I’m [Name] from [Org]. I’m talking with your daughter to make sure we arrange the supports you need. How are you today?”
Participant (in background): “Oh, hello! I’m okay, thank you.”
Family Member: “He can hear you on speaker now. He knows we’re arranging some help for him.”
Intake: “Great, I’ll continue to chat with both of you. So, I understand [Participant Name] has an NDIS plan, and you’re helping to organize his services. Could you tell me a bit about what prompted you to contact us and what supports you’re looking for?”
Family Member: “Sure. My dad had a stroke last year. He’s on the NDIS and currently has some physio and occupational therapy, but we’re looking to get him a regular support worker. I’m worried about him being alone most of the day when I’m at work. He could use help with meals and just someone around in case he needs anything. His speech isn’t great and his right side is weak.”
Intake: “Got it. Thank you for the background. So he’s already receiving physio and OT – is that through another provider or directly through NDIS?”
Family Member: “It’s through another clinic. They’re doing a good job with therapy, so we’d like to keep that as is. What we really need from you is more on the daily living side – kind of like in-home care and companionship.”
Intake: “Absolutely, we can cover that. We have support workers who can come to your dad’s home and help with daily tasks (like preparing lunch, light housekeeping, etc.) and also just be there as a companion, maybe take him for a walk or to the local park if he’s up for it. We can tailor the activities to what he enjoys and what keeps him safe.”
Participant (background): “I do get lonely sometimes, yes.”
Family Member: “He used to be very active socially, so it’s been hard.”
Intake: “I understand. Social connection is so important. We’ll definitely aim to match him with a support worker who shares some of his interests. For example, what does your dad like? Any hobbies or topics he enjoys?”
Family Member: “He loves gardening and watching cricket. He can’t garden like he used to, but he enjoys sitting outside.”
Intake: “That’s great to know. We actually have a support worker in our team, [Support Worker Name], who is an avid cricket fan and is skilled in helping with light gardening tasks. Someone like that might be a good fit to accompany your dad, talk cricket, maybe help him water the plants or just get some fresh air outside safely.”
Family Member: “Oh, that sounds promising! Dad, what do you think? Someone to talk cricket with you?”
Participant: “That would be nice.”
Intake: “Wonderful. Now, let’s talk logistics for a moment. [Participant Name], your NDIS plan – do you know if it’s self-managed or plan-managed, or NDIA-managed? Basically, who pays the bills from the plan?”
Family Member: “It’s agency-managed. The NDIS pays providers directly. He doesn’t handle any of that.”
Intake: “Thanks, that means we’ll just make service bookings in the system and claim payments directly. No worry there. And do you happen to know how many hours or funding is allocated for his daily support? I want to ensure we plan within his budget.”
Family Member: “He has about $20k a year in core supports available. We were thinking of starting with maybe 3 hours a day, Monday to Friday, around midday to afternoon.”
Intake: “That sounds reasonable... We’ll help you keep track so it doesn’t overrun the budget. And if we find he needs more or less, we can adjust.”
Family Member: “Okay, great. Another thing: I usually coordinate everything for him. Is it alright if I continue to be the main contact with you?”
Intake: “Of course... for day-to-day things like scheduling or if we have updates, I’m happy to call or email you.”
Family Member: “Email works for me for records, but phone or text for anything urgent or scheduling is fine too.”
Intake: “Noted. I’ll get all your contacts. Now, next steps: I’d like to schedule a home visit to meet you both in person... Would you be comfortable with that?”
Family Member: “Yes, that’s fine. I’d actually appreciate seeing things in writing.”
Intake: “Definitely... Now, is there a day next week that works for a visit? I can come, and possibly bring that support worker along to introduce.”
Family Member: “Wednesday afternoon would work. I can leave work early to be there by 3 PM.”
Intake: “Okay, Wednesday at 3 PM. Does that suit you too, [Participant Name]?”
Participant: “Yes.”
Intake: “Great!... In the meantime, if you could gather any relevant info – for instance, do you have any notes from his therapists about his routines or safety...?”
Family Member: “Yes, the OT gave us a sheet with some instructions. I’ll have that ready.”
Intake: “Perfect... We’re here to support you as well, not just [Participant].”
Family Member: “Thank you... I’m hopeful this will help him (and me) a great deal.”
Intake: “I’m sure it will... Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up before then.”
Family Member: “Will do. Thanks very much for your help today.”
Participant: “Thank you.”
Intake: “You are both very welcome. Take care, and see you soon.”</pre></div>

Response: “You can tell either of us... The main thing is you should feel comfortable reaching out to whichever one of us you prefer and we’ll sort it out collaboratively.”

Intake: “Glad to hear that. Do you have a few minutes to talk now?”
Participant: “Sure.”
Intake: “Great. So [SC Name] told us a bit about what you’re looking for. I understand you’re interested in getting some occupational therapy and perhaps some help with daily activities at home. Is that right?”
Participant: “Yes... I need a support worker to attend community events with me because I’m still building confidence.”
Intake: “Exactly. We have an occupational therapist on our team who is experienced in stroke recovery... We’re in close contact with [SC Name].”
