      <div class="callout">Context: First-contact call to welcome a new NDIS participant (self-managed or plan-managed), gather essentials, and outline next steps in warm, plain English.</div>
      <h3>Key Information to Gather</h3>

        <li>Participant details: full name, preferred name, DOB, best contact.</li>

        <li>Involved people: support coordinator, family/key contacts.</li>
        <li>Safety/health considerations (mobility, allergies, behaviours, access).</li>

      <h3>Common Concerns & Helpful Responses</h3>
      <details><summary>“Will the NDIS cover all these services?”</summary>
        <div class="callout">Your NDIS plan funds the approved supports we deliver, so there shouldn’t be out-of-pocket costs for those. We’ll keep services within your budget and invoice NDIS/your plan manager directly so you can focus on the support, not the paperwork.</div>

      <details><summary>“I’m new and not sure what happens next.”</summary>
        <div class="callout">No problem — I’ll guide you step by step. Today I’ll ask a few questions to understand your needs, then outline relevant services and next steps in plain English.</div>

        <div class="callout">Since you’re plan‑managed, we’ll invoice your plan manager directly and coordinate with them. You won’t need to manage the financial paperwork.</div>
      </details>
      <details><summary>“How soon can we start?”</summary>
        <div class="callout">After intake we’ll book an initial assessment/meet‑and‑greet, often within 1–2 weeks depending on availability. Tell me if anything is urgent and we’ll prioritise.</div>
      </details>

      <h3>Suggested Next Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Explain relevant services (e.g., OT, physio, support workers) and prepare a clear service agreement summary.</li>
        <li>Schedule first assessment/meet‑and‑greet and confirm preferences.</li>
        <li>Send a simple recap by email/SMS with contacts and appointment details.</li>

        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Hello, this is [Name] from [Organisation]. May I speak with [Participant Name]?</p>
        <p><strong>Participant:</strong> Speaking, hi.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Hi [Participant Name]! We received your details for NDIS supports and I wanted to introduce myself and see how we can help. Is now a good time for about 10–15 minutes?</p>
        <p><strong>Participant:</strong> Yes, that’s fine.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Great. Are you self‑managed or plan‑managed?</p>
        <p><strong>Participant:</strong> Plan‑managed.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Thanks — that means we’ll send invoices to your plan manager directly. Could I grab their name and email?</p>
        <p><strong>Participant:</strong> Bright Plan Management — plan@brightpm.com.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Noted. What supports are you hoping for — daily living help, therapy, getting out and about?</p>
        <p><strong>Participant:</strong> Morning personal care most days, weekly outings, and some physio.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Perfect — we can help with all of those. Roughly how many mornings per week?</p>
        <p><strong>Participant:</strong> Daily for mornings; outings once a week.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Great. Could I note your NDIS number and DOB?</p>
        <p><strong>Participant:</strong> 123456789; 5 May 1980.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Thanks. I see your plan runs to next June — we’ll align to that. Next step: we’ll book an initial meeting — afternoons okay?</p>
        <p><strong>Participant:</strong> Afternoons are best.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> How about Thursday 2:00 pm? I can attend with our physio [Name].</p>
        <p><strong>Participant:</strong> That works.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Excellent. I’ll send a recap and our service agreement to review at your pace. Any questions for me right now?</p>
        <p><strong>Participant:</strong> No, that covers it.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Wonderful — we’re looking forward to working with you!</p>

        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Yes, I’m [Participant]’s daughter. Thanks for calling.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Thanks for helping coordinate. (Warmly) Hi [Participant Name]! I’m [Name] from [Org] — we’ll chat together to arrange supports you’re comfortable with.</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> He’s on speaker — he has some hearing difficulty, so I handle calls.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Understood. What prompted you to reach out and what supports are you hoping for?</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> He had a stroke; we’d like regular in‑home support for meals and company. He already has physio/OT elsewhere.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> We can help with daily living and community access. Any interests we can match on?</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> He loves gardening and cricket.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Great — we’ll look to match a worker who enjoys those. Is his plan self/plan/agency‑managed?</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Agency‑managed.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Perfect — we’ll create service bookings and claim directly. Rough hours in mind?</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> About 3 hrs/day Mon–Fri around midday; ~$20k core available.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> That’s workable. We’ll monitor budget and adjust if needed. Are you happy to be primary contact for scheduling and updates?</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Yes — email for records, phone/text for urgent matters.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Noted. Next: we’ll organise a home visit and bring a potential worker to introduce. We’ll send a simple service agreement for review beforehand.</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Wednesday 3 pm works.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Locked in. If you can have any OT transfer notes handy (e.g., safe transfers), that helps our team support him safely.</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> We have an instruction sheet — we’ll have it ready.</p>

        <p><strong>Participant:</strong> Yes, please CC her.</p>

        <h4>Scripted Dialogue</h4>
        <p><strong>Intake (Clinical):</strong> Thanks for speaking with me about [Participant]. This is a judgement‑free chat to understand what works and what doesn’t.</p>

        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> What helps in the moment and what makes it worse?</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Space, removing throwables, and talking about trains helps. PRN is authorised but rare.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> We’ll obtain the PBSP and align with it, using PRN only per protocol. We’ll assign trained staff, start with a meet‑and‑greet around his interests, and keep a small consistent team. Can we book Thursday 3 pm in the backyard with his trains?</p>
        <p><strong>Family:</strong> That’s ideal.</p>
        <p><strong>Intake:</strong> Great — we’ll bring a worker who’s read up on trains, plus I’ll email a document list (PBSP, med list) and draft the service agreement noting adherence to the plan.</p>
