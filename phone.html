      <h2>2b) Family / Next of Kin — Extended Scripted Dialogue</h2>
      <span class="badge">Dialogue Example</span>
      <div class="script">
        <p><b>Intake:</b> Hello, this is [Name] from [Your Organization]. I’m looking to speak with [Family Member Name] – I was told you’re the best contact regarding [Participant Name]’s NDIS supports?</p>
        <p><b>Family Member:</b> Yes, that’s me. I’m [Participant Name]’s daughter. Thanks for calling.</p>
        <p><b>Intake:</b> Thank you for reaching out on [Participant Name]’s behalf. How are you both doing today?</p>
        <p><b>Family Member:</b> We’re doing alright. My dad (Participant) is here with me. He’s a bit hard of hearing, so I tend to handle the phone conversations.</p>
        <p><b>Intake:</b> I understand. Hi [Participant Name] (speaking a bit louder and clearer)! I’m [Name] from [Org]. I’m talking with your daughter to make sure we arrange the supports you need. How are you today?</p>
        <p><b>Participant:</b> Oh, hello! I’m okay, thank you.</p>
        <p><b>Family Member:</b> He can hear you on speaker now. He knows we’re arranging some help for him.</p>
        <p><b>Intake:</b> Great, I’ll continue to chat with both of you. So, I understand [Participant Name] has an NDIS plan, and you’re helping to organize his services. Could you tell me a bit about what prompted you to contact us and what supports you’re looking for?</p>
        <p><b>Family Member:</b> Sure. My dad had a stroke last year... (full extended dialogue continues as provided by user).</p>

    <!-- ========== SCENARIO 3 ========== -->
    <section id="s3">
      <h2>3) Support Coordinator Referral</h2>
      <span class="badge">Caller Type & Role</span> Intake Officer (admin or clinical) calling a participant referred by their Support Coordinator.
      <p><b>Context:</b> A support coordinator (SC) has provided details to initiate services. Acknowledge SC’s role and clarify a three‑way partnership between participant, SC, and provider.</p>

      <h3>Key Information to Gather</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Participant’s understanding of referral and services expected.</li>
        <li>Name of SC/organisation and whether to include them in future communications.</li>
        <li>Participant’s goals and needs in their own words.</li>
        <li>Logistics: plan management, urgent priorities, timelines.</li>
        <li>Comfort level with SC’s continued involvement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Common Concerns / Responses</h3>
      <details open>
        <summary>“Do I need to coordinate between you and my SC?”</summary>
        <div class="callout">We work closely with your SC so you don’t have to relay messages. With your permission, we keep them updated, so you’re never stuck in the middle.</div>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>“Who do I contact with questions – you or my SC?”</summary>
        <div class="callout">You can contact either. If it’s about direct services, call us. If it’s plan/funding, call your SC. We keep each other in the loop (with your consent).</div>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>“Will my SC stay involved?”</summary>
        <div class="callout">Yes, if you want them to. SCs monitor plan use and can add services/equipment while we deliver day‑to‑day supports. We act as one team.</div>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>“Do I need to repeat everything my SC already told you?”</summary>
        <div class="callout">Your SC shared background, but we’d love to hear your goals in your own words. That ensures nothing important is missed.</div>
      </details>

      <h3>Suggested Next Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Review referral details before call; update SC after contact.</li>
        <li>Offer joint meeting (participant + SC + provider) for complex needs.</li>
        <li>Confirm communication preferences (e.g., cc SC in updates).</li>
        <li>Prepare service agreement and service bookings; notify SC when finalised.</li>
        <li>Clarify reporting expectations for plan reviews.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="script">
        <div class="label">Scripted Dialogue (Read‑ready)</div>
        <p><b>Intake:</b> Hi [Participant Name], this is [Name] from [Your Organization]. Your support coordinator, [SC Name], asked me to give you a call. How are you today?</p>
        <p><b>Participant:</b> Oh hi, yes, [SC Name] mentioned you’d be calling. I’m good, thanks.</p>
        <p><b>Intake:</b> Glad to hear that. Do you have a few minutes to talk now?</p>
        <p><b>Participant:</b> Sure.</p>
        <p><b>Intake:</b> Great. [SC Name] told us a bit about what you’re looking for – OT and daily living help. Could you share your top priorities in your own words?</p>
        <p><b>Participant:</b> I’d like to shower on my own again and start cooking simple meals.</p>
        <p><b>Intake:</b> Excellent goals. Our OT can assess and suggest modifications (grab rails, adaptive kitchen tools) and our support workers can help practice these skills safely. Are you happy for us to keep [SC Name] in the loop?</p>
        <p><b>Participant:</b> Yes, please. She helps coordinate everything.</p>
        <p><b>Intake:</b> Perfect. With your permission, I’ll copy her into our updates. For scheduling: our OT has Wednesdays 10 AM free – does that suit?</p>
        <p><b>Participant:</b> Yes, that works.</p>
        <p><b>Intake:</b> Great. We’ll start OT on Wednesdays, and we’ll introduce a support worker the following week (Mon & Fri 2 PM). I’ll draft a service agreement, send it to you and [SC Name], and set up service bookings in the portal. Before your plan review in 8 months, we’ll provide a progress report for your SC to use. How does that sound?</p>
        <p><b>Participant:</b> That sounds great. Thanks for coordinating everything.</p>
        <p><b>Intake:</b> You’re very welcome. Big thanks to [SC Name] for connecting us. Looking forward to working with you, [Participant Name].</p>

            <p><b>Intake:</b> Hello, this is [Name] from [Your Organization]. I’m looking to speak with [Family Member Name] – I was told you’re the best contact regarding [Participant Name]’s NDIS supports?</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> Yes, that’s me. I’m [Participant Name]’s daughter. Thanks for calling.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Thank you for reaching out on [Participant Name]’s behalf. How are you both doing today?</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> We’re doing alright. My dad (Participant) is here with me. He’s a bit hard of hearing, so I tend to handle the phone conversations.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> I understand. Hi [Participant Name] (speaking a bit louder and clearer)! I’m [Name] from [Org]. I’m talking with your daughter to make sure we arrange the supports you need. How are you today?</p>
            <p><b>Participant (in background):</b> Oh, hello! I’m okay, thank you.</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> He can hear you on speaker now. He knows we’re arranging some help for him.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Great, I’ll continue to chat with both of you. So, I understand [Participant Name] has an NDIS plan, and you’re helping to organize his services. Could you tell me a bit about what prompted you to contact us and what supports you’re looking for?</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> Sure. My dad had a stroke last year. He’s on the NDIS and currently has some physio and occupational therapy, but we’re looking to get him a regular support worker. I’m worried about him being alone most of the day when I’m at work. He could use help with meals and just someone around in case he needs anything. His speech isn’t great and his right side is weak.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Got it. Thank you for the background. So he’s already receiving physio and OT – is that through another provider or directly through NDIS?</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> It’s through another clinic. They’re doing a good job with therapy, so we’d like to keep that as is. What we really need from you is more on the daily living side – kind of like in-home care and companionship.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Absolutely, we can cover that. We have support workers who can come to your dad’s home and help with daily tasks (like preparing lunch, light housekeeping, etc.) and also just be there as a companion, maybe take him for a walk or to the local park if he’s up for it. We can tailor the activities to what he enjoys and what keeps him safe.</p>
            <p><b>Participant (background):</b> I do get lonely sometimes, yes.</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> He used to be very active socially, so it’s been hard.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> I understand. Social connection is so important. We’ll definitely aim to match him with a support worker who shares some of his interests. For example, what does your dad like? Any hobbies or topics he enjoys?</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> He loves gardening and watching cricket. He can’t garden like he used to, but he enjoys sitting outside.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> That’s great to know. We actually have a support worker in our team, [Support Worker Name], who is an avid cricket fan and is skilled in helping with light gardening tasks. Someone like that might be a good fit to accompany your dad, talk cricket, maybe help him water the plants or just get some fresh air outside safely.</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> Oh, that sounds promising! Dad, what do you think? Someone to talk cricket with you?</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> That would be nice.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Wonderful. Now, let’s talk logistics for a moment. [Participant Name], your NDIS plan – do you know if it’s self-managed or plan-managed, or NDIA-managed? Basically, who pays the bills from the plan?</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> It’s agency-managed. The NDIS pays providers directly. He doesn’t handle any of that.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Thanks, that means we’ll just make service bookings in the system and claim payments directly. No worry there. And do you happen to know how many hours or funding is allocated for his daily support? I want to ensure we plan within his budget.</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> He has about $20k a year in core supports available. We were thinking of starting with maybe 3 hours a day, Monday to Friday, around midday to afternoon.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> That sounds reasonable. Rough math, that should be sustainable with $20k for quite a few months, and then plans usually renew annually. We can fine-tune it. We’ll help you keep track so it doesn’t overrun the budget. And if we find he needs more or less, we can adjust.</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> Okay, great. Another thing: I usually coordinate everything for him. Is it alright if I continue to be the main contact with you? I’ll make sure he’s informed and involved in decisions, but it’s just easier for scheduling and so on.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Of course. We appreciate a dedicated family contact — it makes communication smoother. We’ll involve your dad in key discussions, and for day-to-day scheduling we’ll contact you by your preferred channel. If your dad wants to speak directly or one-on-one at any time, we’ll arrange that too.</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> Email works for me for records, but phone or text for anything urgent or scheduling is fine too.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Noted. I’ll capture your contact details. Next steps: I’d like to schedule a home visit. We can introduce a potential support worker (like the cricket fan I mentioned) to check the fit. We’ll also go over a service agreement — a simple document outlining services and responsibilities. I’ll email a draft beforehand so you can review comfortably.</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> Yes, that’s fine. I’d appreciate seeing it in writing.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Perfect. Is there a day next week that works for a visit? I can come, and possibly bring that support worker along to introduce.</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> Wednesday afternoon would work. I can leave work early to be there by 3 PM.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Okay, Wednesday at 3 PM. Does that suit you too, [Participant Name]?</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> Yes.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Great! In the meantime, if you could gather any relevant info — e.g., therapist notes about routines or safety (transfer techniques). That helps our worker assist safely from chair to walker, etc.</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> Yes, the OT gave us a sheet with some instructions. I’ll have that ready.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Perfect. Our goal is to support your dad and make both of you feel comfortable and confident. You’ve done a fantastic job — we’re here to share that load.</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> Thank you. It’s been a journey, but I’m hopeful this will help.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> We’re looking forward to meeting you on Wednesday. I’ll send the email with contact info, draft agreement, and appointment confirmation shortly. Reach out if anything comes up.</p>
            <p><b>Family Member:</b> Will do. Thanks very much.</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> Thank you.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> You’re both very welcome. Take care, and see you soon.</p>

          <li>Agree on communications (e.g., CC SC on scheduling and monthly progress notes).</li>
          <li>Set up service agreement and NDIS service bookings; let the SC know once in place.</li>
          <li>Outline reporting cadence (e.g., short report before plan review).</li>

            <p><b>Intake:</b> Hi [Participant Name], this is [Name] from [Your Organization]. Your support coordinator, [SC Name], asked me to give you a call. How are you today?</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> Oh hi, yes, [SC Name] mentioned you’d be calling. I’m good, thanks.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Glad to hear that. Do you have a few minutes to talk now?</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> Sure.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Great. So [SC Name] told us a bit about what you’re looking for. I understand you’re interested in getting some occupational therapy and perhaps some help with daily activities at home. Is that right?</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> Yes. In my NDIS plan, we put goals about becoming more independent at home. I had a stroke, so I need to re-learn some things. [SC Name] said an OT could help with home modifications and improving my arm usage. And also maybe a support worker to help me practice tasks or go out, because I’m still building confidence.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Exactly. We have an occupational therapist on our team who is experienced in stroke recovery, [Therapist Name]. We also have support workers who can assist with implementing what you practice in therapy, and getting you out into the community safely. I’m really glad [SC Name] connected you with us – it sounds like we can put together a good plan for those supports.</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> That sounds good. [SC Name] thought you’d be a good fit.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Happy to hear that! Could I hear your top priorities in your own words? What would you most like to achieve in the next six months?</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> I’d like to shower on my own again and do some cooking. If I could even do simple meal prep, I’d be happy.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Great goals. Our OT will assess your home for modifications/equipment (e.g., grab rails, adaptive kitchen tools) and techniques to increase independence. A support worker can attend practice sessions (like cooking) to ensure safety and help implement strategies.</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> We already have a shower chair from the hospital.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Perfect. The OT will check if anything else would help. Are you happy for us to keep [SC Name] in the loop on plans and progress?</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> Yes, please. She usually coordinates everything.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> With your permission, I’ll CC her in our follow-up and major updates. After the first assessment we’ll send a short summary to you both. If we need additional resources, we’ll discuss together.</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> Great.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Scheduling: [SC Name] mentioned weekly OT and support work twice a week in the afternoons. Does that align with your preference?</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> Yes, I’m free most days.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Our OT, [Therapist Name], has Wednesdays 10 AM available. For support work, we can start the following week Mondays and Fridays at 2 PM. We’ll choose someone with a therapy-informed background and introduce them properly.</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> That works. My husband’s usually home then too.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Formalities: we’ll prepare a service agreement outlining services and NDIS‑compliant prices. Since you’re agency‑managed, we’ll also set up service bookings in the NDIS portal. I’ll coordinate that with [SC Name].</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> Okay.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Any other questions or concerns? Also, your plan review is in about 8 months — we can provide a concise progress report beforehand to support that.</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> That’s perfect. No other questions.</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> Recap: OT Wednesdays 10 AM (assessment first), support worker Mon & Fri 2 PM (start week of [date]). I’ll email the agreement and summary, CC [SC Name]. Together we’ll work toward your showering and cooking goals. Sound good?</p>
            <p><b>Participant:</b> Sounds great. Thank you!</p>
            <p><b>Intake:</b> You’re very welcome — thanks to [SC Name] for the intro. I’ll follow up by email shortly. Have a wonderful day!</p>

        <h2>4) Complex Needs (e.g. Behaviours of Concern, Restrictive Practices)</h2>
        <span class="badge">Caller Type & Role</span> Senior Intake Coordinator or Clinical Intake Specialist calling a participant or guardian/caregiver with complex support needs.
        <p class="muted"><b>Context:</b> Behaviours of concern and/or authorised restrictive practices may be present. Handle with sensitivity and expertise. Emphasise capability, safety, dignity, and Positive Behaviour Support (PBS). Gather detailed triggers, effective strategies, and any formal behaviour support plans.</p>

        <h3>Key Information to Gather</h3>
        <ul class="two-col">
          <li>Description of behaviours (e.g., aggression, self‑harm, absconding), frequency, typical triggers.</li>
          <li>What prevents/de‑escalates incidents; what hasn’t worked.</li>
          <li>Positive Behaviour Support Plan (PBSP) details; behaviour support practitioner involvement (request copy with consent).</li>
          <li>Restrictive practices currently used and authorisations (e.g., lap belt, PRN medication). Clarify that questions are to prepare, not judge; practices must be authorised and plan‑based.</li>
          <li>Staff safety: special training, precautions, 1:1 or 2:1 staffing, environmental safety (lock away sharps, etc.).</li>
          <li>Clinician involvement (psychologist, psychiatrist, specialists) and coordination needs.</li>
          <li>Communication style (verbal, AAC/device, non‑verbal) and comprehension level.</li>
          <li>Environments for support (home, day program), sensory setup, modifications (sensory room, gated yard).</li>
          <li>Family/caregiver priorities beyond safety (e.g., reduce sedation, teach alternative communication for anger).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Concerns / Objections & Responses</h3>
        <details open>
          <summary>“I’m afraid no provider will stick around once they see his behaviours.”</summary>
          <div class="callout ok">Our team is trained for high‑support needs. We view behaviours as communication and follow PBS. We prioritise consistency, patience, and trust — we won’t be scared off.</div>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>“Will your staff cope with meltdowns or aggression?”</summary>
          <div class="callout">Yes. Staff receive de‑escalation and safe crisis management training and follow the behaviour plan precisely. We avoid restrictive practices unless authorised and absolutely necessary, and we review to reduce them over time.</div>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>“There’s PRN medication in crises — how do you handle that?”</summary>
          <div class="callout">We follow the prescribed protocol within the PBSP. We prioritise least‑restrictive strategies first (diversion, sensory tools, quiet space). PRN is a last resort, and every use triggers a review to learn and improve.</div>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>“Will my family member be treated with respect?”</summary>
          <div class="callout">Absolutely. We separate the behaviour from the person, get to know strengths and preferences, and provide non‑judgemental, rights‑based support. If a staff fit isn’t right, we address it quickly.</div>
        </details>

        <h3>Suggested Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Book a comprehensive in‑person meeting with key people (family, caregivers, behaviour practitioner). Include participant as tolerated to build rapport.</li>
          <li>Obtain documentation: PBSP, safety plans, incident reports, medication list (with consent) and coordinate with existing clinicians.</li>
          <li>Arrange specialised training or refreshers specific to the participant’s needs (autism‑specific strategies, safe restraint where authorised).</li>
          <li>Assign a small, consistent team (e.g., 2–3 staff) and plan shadowing before solo shifts.</li>
          <li>Co‑develop a crisis plan (who to call, thresholds for escalation, emergency steps).</li>
          <li>Track incident data and triggers; set regular reviews to adjust strategies and measure progress.</li>
          <li>Offer caregiver support and validation; provide contacts for carer supports where appropriate.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="script">
          <div class="label">Scripted Dialogue (Read‑ready)</div>
          <p><b>Intake (Clinical Specialist):</b> Hello, [Name]? This is [Your Name] from [Your Organization]. I’m calling about [Participant Name] and the supports you inquired about. How are you today?</p>
          <p><b>Family/Caregiver:</b> Hi. I’m okay, a bit anxious to discuss this actually.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> That’s totally understandable. I really appreciate you taking the time. This is a judgement‑free conversation — our goal is to understand how we can best support [Participant Name]. I’ve read the referral mentioning behaviours of concern, but it helps to hear from you what a typical day looks like and what challenges you’re facing.</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> [Participant] is my 20‑year‑old son with autism and intellectual disability. He can be very sweet, but has aggressive outbursts when overwhelmed. Yesterday we asked him to turn off the TV for dinner and he snapped — yelling, throwing things, and he hit my arm. This happens a few times a week.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> I’m sorry you experienced that. When an outburst occurs, how long does it usually last?</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> About 10–15 minutes at peak, then 30 minutes to settle.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> What helps or makes it worse during those moments?</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> We don’t yell or restrain unless there’s immediate danger. We remove throwables and give space. Quietly talking about his favourite topic — trains — helps. As a last resort there’s a PRN sedative; used four times last year.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> Those are solid strategies. Is the PRN documented within an authorised Positive Behaviour Support Plan?</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> Yes — we have a PBSP from a psychologist; PRN is authorised as a restrictive practice.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> Understood. With your permission, we’ll obtain that plan and any recent incident reports so our team can align closely. We always follow existing plans consistently.</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> I’ll email it and connect you with the psychologist.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> Thank you. Besides the PRN, are any other restrictive practices used (e.g., physical restraint, seclusion)?</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> No physical restraint or seclusion. Mainly the PRN if there’s serious risk.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> Thanks for clarifying. Our aim is prevention and reduction of restrictive practices over time. What are common triggers — transitions, unexpected changes, sensory overload, communication frustration?</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> Exactly those. Transitions and plan changes, noisy or crowded places, and trouble expressing himself under stress.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> We’ll plan around that: use visual schedules and warnings (e.g., “5 more minutes of TV, then dinner”), avoid sudden changes, and substitute cancelled activities with preferred alternatives when possible.</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> That would help a lot.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> What would you like our service to do specifically?</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> A skilled support worker a few afternoons a week to engage him and build coping/daily living skills, plus behaviour support oversight to coach workers and review incidents.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> We can assign a specialist to supervise (review data, align with your psychologist, coach staff) and provide consistent workers Mon/Wed/Fri afternoons to practice skills and give respite. We’ll start with shadowing so they aren’t alone initially. Small, stable team for trust.</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> We’ve had workers quit before — that’s our worry.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> I’m sorry that happened. We’ll only assign trained staff, begin with meet‑and‑greet + shadowing, and keep the roster tight (2–3 people). If a match isn’t right, we’ll act quickly — stability is the goal.</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> Routine definitely helps him.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> Great. Let’s plan a low‑demand meet‑and‑greet where he’s comfortable (e.g., backyard with trains). We’ll brief the worker to bring relevant interests to build rapport.</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> He’d love that.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> Because PRN is involved, we’ll ensure proper consent/authorisations on file. Our service agreement will state that we follow the PBSP and maintain regular contact with your psychologist. Clear commitments from day one.</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> I appreciate a detailed agreement.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> Funding‑wise, do you have ‘Improved Relationships’ for behaviour support? If more is needed for training/updates we can discuss options together.</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> Yes, there’s some funding left.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> Perfect. Immediate next step: meet‑and‑greet Thursday 3 PM with [Support Worker Name] if that’s a calm time for him?</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> 3 PM works — usually a calm time.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> Great — we’ll meet in the backyard with his train set. I’ll email: document checklist (PBSP, meds), draft agreement, my contacts, and a proposed plan (hours, specialist involvement). We’ll also set monthly check‑ins for communication.</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> Thank you — this feels organised and reassuring.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> We’re committed to earning your trust and keeping communication open. See you Thursday at 3 PM. If anything changes or you think of more triggers/strategies, message me anytime.</p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> Will do. I feel hopeful for the first time in a while.</p>
          <p><b>Intake:</b> That means a lot. We’ll work to turn that hope into progress. Talk soon!</p>
