        <h2>6) Nursing‑Only Supports Required (Wound Care, PEG Feeding)</h2>
        <span class="badge">Caller Type & Role</span> Intake Nurse (Registered Nurse) calling participant/caregiver requiring clinical supports.
        <p class="muted"><b>Context:</b> Clarify clinical tasks, timing, protocols, supplies, and preferences. Convey competence and empathy; plan contingencies.</p>

        <h3>Key Information to Gather</h3>
        <ul class="two-col">
          <li>Task specifics (wound type/dressing; PEG/PEJ regimen; catheter/injections).</li>
          <li>Frequency and exact times; align to meals/meds where relevant.</li>
          <li>Medical background and orders; discharge instructions.</li>
          <li>Supplies and consumables; ordering and funding pathways.</li>
          <li>Home setup: clean surface, pump/pole, sharps disposal, PPE.</li>
          <li>Pain/comfort; red‑flag symptoms and current management.</li>
          <li>Family involvement; training interest for gradual handover.</li>
          <li>Contingencies (blocked/dislodged tube, worsening wound, late nurse).</li>
          <li>NDIS high‑intensity lines; qualified staff assignment; continuity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Concerns / Responses</h3>
        <details open>
          <summary>“Will the nurse be skilled in my exact task?”</summary>
          <div class="callout ok">Yes — we allocate nurses experienced in your care area, with senior RN oversight and backup.</div>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>“Home isn’t like hospital — is it safe?”</summary>
          <div class="callout">We bring essentials, maintain sterility, and follow hospital‑grade protocols at home using your equipment or prescribed alternatives.</div>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>“Can I have the same nurse?”</summary>
          <div class="callout">Continuity is standard: a primary nurse plus one briefed backup — not a parade of new faces.</div>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>“What if something changes or an emergency occurs?”</summary>
          <div class="callout">We monitor, liaise with GP/specialists, and provide a 24/7 contact. For PEG issues, we’ll troubleshoot or direct you promptly to ED if required.</div>
        </details>

        <h3>Suggested Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Book an initial nursing assessment aligned to first task (e.g., morning PEG feed).</li>
          <li>Confirm orders and set up home charting (paper/electronic).</li>
          <li>Educate and, if desired, gradually teach steps to increase independence.</li>
          <li>Schedule efficient visits; combine tasks safely where possible.</li>
          <li>Arrange consumables and track stock; provide direct nurse line.</li>
          <li>Review after 4–6 weeks to taper or adjust plan.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="script">
          <div class="label">Scripted Dialogue (PEG Example)</div>
          <p><b>Intake Nurse:</b> Hello [Participant], I’m [Name], a nurse with [Your Org]. I understand you have a PEG and need support with feeds and site care — could you walk me through your current routine?</p>
          <p><b>Participant:</b> Three pump feeds (8 AM, 1 PM, 7 PM) with flushes; I’m nervous to manage alone.</p>
          <p><b>Intake Nurse:</b> We’ll attend at those times, manage feeds/site care/meds, and — if you wish — teach steps gradually. You’ll have a 24/7 contact for issues like clogs or dislodgement. We’ll verify medication orders on the first visit and keep continuity with a primary nurse.</p>
