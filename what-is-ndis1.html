    <h1>What Is NDIS and How Can It Help You?</h1>
    <p>A friendly guide for participants and carers exploring NDIS support options.</p>
  </section>

  <main>
    <p><strong>Meet Maya</strong>, a bright 8-year-old who loves to paint. Maya has a physical disability that makes some daily tasks and joining her friends in activities a bit challenging. Her mum, Priya, does everything she can to support Maya, but it can be overwhelming at times. Then they discovered the NDIS – and everything started to change. With NDIS funding, Maya got a custom wheelchair, regular therapy sessions, and a support worker who helps her attend an art class every week. Maya is blossoming, and her mum finally has some breathing room and hope for the future.</p>

    <p>This is just one story of how the NDIS can make a positive difference. Now, let's explore what the NDIS is and how it might help <em>you</em> or your family.</p>

    <h2>What is the NDIS?</h2>
    <p>The NDIS is Australia’s National Disability Insurance Scheme – a government-funded program designed to support people with permanent and significant disabilities. In simpler terms, it’s a way to provide individuals (called <em>participants</em>) with funding for services and support they need to live more independently and achieve their goals.</p>
    <p>Under the NDIS, eligible participants work with a planner or Local Area Coordinator to develop a personalized plan for “reasonable and necessary” supports. It gives people control and choice over the services they receive and how they’re delivered.</p>

    <h2>How Does the NDIS Benefit Individuals with Disabilities?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Greater Independence:</strong> Support like wheelchairs, assistive tech, or workers can make daily life easier.</li>
      <li><strong>Improved Wellbeing:</strong> Therapies and supports can improve mental, physical, and emotional health.</li>
      <li><strong>Skill Building and Goals:</strong> Funding can support job coaching, training, or learning hobbies and passions.</li>
      <li><strong>Community Participation:</strong> Support for joining activities and social groups to stay engaged and connected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Services and Supports Does the NDIS Cover?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Care</strong> – Help with daily living tasks like showering and dressing</li>
      <li><strong>Therapies</strong> – Physiotherapy, OT, speech, psychology etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Assistive Technology</strong> – Wheelchairs, mobility aids, communication devices</li>
      <li><strong>Home & Vehicle Modifications</strong> – Ramps, rails, car conversions</li>
      <li><strong>Community Access</strong> – Attending outings, clubs, events</li>
      <li><strong>Employment/Education Support</strong> – Help with work or learning</li>
      <li><strong>Respite</strong> – Short-term accommodation or in-home support so carers get a break</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Does the NDIS Support Carers?</h2>
    <p>NDIS indirectly helps carers by giving participants the tools and support to be more independent. It can also include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Respite care</strong> so carers can rest or attend to their own needs</li>
      <li><strong>Support worker funding</strong> to ease daily responsibilities</li>
      <li><strong>Training and counseling</strong> for carers to feel confident and supported</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Start Your NDIS Journey</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Check eligibility</strong> – Must be under 65, Australian resident, and have permanent disability</li>
      <li><strong>Access Request</strong> – Contact NDIA and submit required documents</li>
      <li><strong>Planning meeting</strong> – Discuss your needs and goals</li>
      <li><strong>NDIS Plan created</strong> – Tailored to your supports and reviewed yearly</li>
      <li><strong>Choose providers</strong> – Like HD Heed, who can help deliver supports</li>
    </ol>

    <p>NDIS can feel overwhelming, but step-by-step help is available. Providers like <strong>HD Heed</strong> are here to guide you. Reach out if you need support understanding or applying for NDIS services – you're not alone.</p>
